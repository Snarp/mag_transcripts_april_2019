rusty quill presents lucid by Elizabeth

Richards

[Music]

the moment comes slowly in with a

sharpness when a mundane dream focuses

into lucidity it's an awareness that

must be cupped lightly like water in the

palm or else my mind jolts itself awake

the dream world fades then becoming

impossible to grasp I recall it

distantly like a past visit to somewhere

far away it is difficult afterwards to

describe those memories of my own

sleeping world to anyone else my dreams

are more than fragments of sight or

sound there is a pulsing sense of

continuing life about them there are

patterns which have reappeared for years

the roads and neighborhoods of my

hometown childhood landmarks which my

mind revisits Mirador shifted north into

south city inter field the streets and

buildings become merged mixed with

larger distant cities as I travel in my

waking life accumulated impressions of

places built into an inner world then

there are the landmarks which live only

in my dreams repeated and familiar they

might return months apart when I find

myself lucid among their walls and

doorways I immediately recognize their

surprisingly unchanged details the

shuttered abandoned petrol station where

in reality there are only friendly

suburban houses the small brown house

with carpeted hallways and cellar

tunnels crushingly tight where normally

a bright ice-cream shop sits next to a

school

at some point becoming lucid for me was

no longer about the excitement or the

rewriting of dream plants moments I

became lucid or opportunities to explore

these places which existed only in my

dreams could only be visited in that

half waking vision upon actually waking

I would fill my dream journal with

sketches and notes trying to understand

what these places which seemed so

important and real to me might mean I

assumed they were some aspect of my

psyche some flavor of my soul that would

helped me better understand myself when

I encountered thee other than us it was

not in these places but in a watchful

pair of eyes a man was standing quietly

outside my dream city hall there were

many people walking the sidewalks and

the plot of my dream was comfortingly

usual I was late to an appointment or

maybe I was on my way to go shopping

I was only slightly aware that I was in

my other city the shifted place I wasn't

yet aware enough to really explore still

I was moving slowly and feeling curious

when I realized the man was looking at

me I stopped his posture seemed friendly

and normal gazing into his eyes however

I felt the hazy sluggishness of

everything burn off a knowledge became

clear I was dreaming I was lucid

dreaming and there was a thing in my

dream looking out of eyes which I'd

imagined my idea of a business man in a

suit the man and the suit were part of

my dream worlds they were familiar but

there was a presence behind his eyes

that was not of me

my world the wrongness I couldn't

explain to myself any more than I could

adequately explain my dreams to another

person I turned to run and woke up

instantly it was still hours until dawn

I feared that if I went back to sleep

I'd see whatever it was again looking

through those eyes with an awareness I

too never before encountered in any of

my many dreams so I unlocked my phone

wasted a few hours online until I felt

exhausted until the dream felt distant

enough to be written off as a weird

nightmare I was able to sleep again

fitfully and without dreaming as much as

this unfamiliar presence had disturbed

me I couldn't hold on to the fear in the

morning light how many times that I

stumbled across strange buildings or

distorted scenery that I'd never known

until I found them while lucid dreaming

often those places could be unsettling

and creepy and while they felt real and

solid when I walked among them

I'd always accepted they were crafted by

some remote part of myself they became

familiar with repeated visits and there

were still times I'd make new

discoveries my dreams had a way of

surprising me the way the world seemed

to build itself couldn't there be parts

so distant from my consciousness that I

would perceive them as anomalies when it

returned to my dream world weeks later

the other nurse rose inside her body

with long spindle legs that bent at many

joints it rocked and lurched as it

slowly moved towards me as if it were

unsure of how to move those impossible

limbs

the figure was still a recognizable

human shell still wore a business suit I

would even claim the Warped body as

another creation of my own mind but

whatever sat invisibly inside the

distorted form repulsed me beyond

explanation I ran upstairs and down

industrial alleyways I ran faster than

the crawling thing with those awkward

legs could run I was only awake enough

to know that I could run even fly away

no matter how many city blocks I put

between myself and the sense of it no

matter how high I tried to float away

towards rooftops and safety I felt it

pressing on me I didn't need to see into

its eyes anymore to know it was not

created by me or my subconscious its

presence had an alien friction that was

prowling my dreamscape I had a sense of

those legs growing longer and more

jointed as the presence pursued me

eventually I became too lucid to hold

the terrifying hunt in my mind I

startled awake at 4 a.m. it was enough

to stay awake to let an early shower

chase away the lingering crawling

sensations whatever my visitor was it

had dissipated it was beyond my

understanding and wandering in a place

that felt so distant from my waking life

that it was easier to let it go

and avoid dwelling on it in the nights

that followed I remembered a little of

my dreams those dreams which I could

recall I was barely lucid caught in

fuzzy and chaotic dramas that had no

logic or structure when I finally

stumbled onto the other 'no Segen

it wasn't moving at all I dreamt I was

near an industrial factory I'd never

seen before

an ordinary kind of nonsense dream

perhaps nothing that was tied to my

repeated lucid a dreamscape a path led

towards two doors side by side a great

line of people were following each other

single-file into the door on the left

everything about the factory in the

doors was rusted and dirty but it felt

strangely safe and Tom I wanted to

follow the crowd inside but before I

could enter the left doorway I felt a

scratch upon the Lucid part of my mind I

went to the door on the right instead it

was solid metal heavy and imposing

suddenly the calm was gone the factory

before me felt terrible and wrong still

I had to explore I had to understand why

I had to know where it led I wanted to

know what it could mean I opened the

door slowly waiting for a darkness to

jump out and take me instead I found

myself at the top of a long metal

staircase built of grated iron flush

against one wall and leading steeply

down the rooms details became clearer

enough that I knew I would soon wake up

at the bottom of the metal stairs was an

immense empty warehouse like a great

cabin plunging down in front of me into

my right to my left was only solid wall

all of the walls were covered in bolted

steel plates between a few tall darkened

glass windows

high above me a single bright light bulb

rocked slightly hanging from a long thin

wire extending out of the darkness of a

vaulted ceiling I walked a little way

down the stairs then leaned over the

railings to look at what was below the

warehouse was empty but for a simple

metal folding chair at the bottom

propped open on a cracked concrete floor

and sent directly below the light an

empty warehouse but for the chair and

the space above the chair so clearly

filled with an unseen are than us that I

screamed a loud shout that died quickly

into an oppressive silence the intrusion

into my mind was overwhelming crushing

paralyzing I felt frozen still high

above on the staircase as the light

began to flicker off and on over and

over or the room became sharper and more

real I waited for my mind to be jolted

out of the dream to be forced awake I

was certain I was dreaming I could feel

the corroded iron banister cut into my

palms I could feel the breath and pulse

of my dream body I could feel the weight

of gravity as I leaned over the edge

unable to move back

unable to move at all in the moments of

darkness I couldn't see the chair when

the light flicked back on I braced

myself expecting it to be filled with

visible proof of the immense presence I

knew was there a presence watching me

and waiting but the chair remained empty

and distant below me hours passed as I

was tossed between the darkness the

harsh light whatever had been inside the

businessman and the creature it was now

free from any mask or shell waiting

invisibly upon the chair paralyzed and

still hoping for the dream to end I

could feel the presence welling up like

a spring it filled the warehouse went

past the bolted steel and glass down

pathways through carpeted halls past

every shuttered window down every street

and alley way distantly I still wondered

if whatever this was this living

presence which I had stumbled upon in my

curiosity could ever be called a part of

my mind if so it was from such deaths

but I couldn't lay any claim of control

over the being now flooding my

dreamscape

when my morning alarm sent me reeling

back into my bedroom it was only habit

that led my hands to the pen on my

nightstand habits to open my dream

journal nothing had dissipated with the

morning light filtering through my

curtains and as the ink moved on the

page the words and drawings were not my

home what belongs to my mind and what

does not as fragmented beyond my

recognition here in my bedroom reality

is turning slowly yet sharply

there is an itching sense in the air of

a lens slowly turning into focus

something is waking up within the

Dreaming world
