<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: [echoing] Hello? I -- anyone? What's - what's going on? What is this place? Where...</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: Help? Please? Anybody?</span>

<span class="sarah-nikola">SARAH!NIKOLA: *I'm* somebody.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : [stammering] What? Who are you?</span>

<span class="sarah-nikola">SARAH!NIKOLA: What an *excellent* question.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : You - you stay away from me.</span>

<span class="sarah-nikola">SARAH!NIKOLA: "Sarah", "Daniel"... sometimes I think I'm just not built for names. A hundred puppets, a hundred pointless names.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : I-I don't understand.</span>

<span class="sarah-nikola">SARAH!NIKOLA: Of course you don't. You *can't*. Not anymore.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : What? I don't... I don't... who are you?</span>

<span class="sarah-nikola">SARAH!NIKOLA: [chuckling] It's me, Jon. It's Tim.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : Jon. Jon?</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: Yes, that's your name, and I'm Tim, your friend.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : Tim?</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: Yes. Jon, you can relax.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : No -- no, no, no--</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: [overlapping] Everything is going to be alright.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : No, Tim, we've - we've got to stop it.</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: Stop what?</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : I...</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: And how *are* you going to stop it?</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : [stammering] I have, I have... I thought that this, this...</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: I - I don't know.</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: Well, don't you worry. I'm sure we can work it out together.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : Oh, yes. Yes - Tim, I just I need a second, to... uh-</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: Of course, Jon.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : Jon. Yes, that's - that's me.</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: Give it to me.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : [disoriented] Yes, yes, if you could, I'd - I'd value your input on it...</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: Tim.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : Yes, Tim. Tim.</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: Now let's take a look at this.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : Please.</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: Right now, what we have here is our handheld remote detonator.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : A what?</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: It talks to a bomb.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : Wait. Wait, uh...</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: I imagine if you'd use it, we'd all have come to quite a nasty end.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST : That was - uh, that was-</span>

<span class="tim-nikola">TIM!NIKOLA: [giggling] Don't you worry, Archivist, it's all in good hands.</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: Get away from me! </span>

<span class="basira">BASIRA: [slurred] It's alright. I'm not - I'm not one of them.</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: *Everyone* is, this isn't - just get back.</span>

<span class="basira">BASIRA: Okay, okay who - who are you?</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: [agitated] I don't *know*, do I?</span>

<span class="basira">BASIRA: What can we do?</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: It's too late. There's *nothing*.</span>

<span class="basira">BASIRA: There must be. We just need to figure this out. I - I know I'm me...</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: So what's your name? Huh? Who exactly is "me"?</span>

<span class="basira">BASIRA: Doesn't matter. Names don't matter. I just... I know - I know I'm me and I know I'm here.</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: Bullshit, "*here*" is just -- [groans] </span>

<span class="basira">BASIRA: There's things that - that they're not me, they want to hurt me, but. I don't want to hurt you.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: It isn't - it isn't real.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: What isn't real, Jon?</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: I-I-I don't know. None of this is real.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: But it is! Just because you don't understand doesn't mean it's a lie.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: Who are you?</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: [unconvincingly] Why, I'm.... Tim of course! Who else would I be?</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: You're not. You're not Tim.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Oh, you caught me! I'm *Sasha*!</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: *Shut up!*</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Really, it's me! Sasha... whatever-her-name-was! Back from the dead, just like you wanted!</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: Get away from me or I swear, or I'll -</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Or you'll what? Hit me? Go on then, try it - make a fist.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: I... I...</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Do you even know which of these hands is yours?</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: Stop... stop, stand still.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Do you even know what a hand *is?*</span>

<span class="gertrude-nikola">GERTRUDE!NIKOLA: Pathetic.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: Wait. Wait, I - I know you.</span>

<span class="gertrude-nikola">GERTRUDE!NIKOLA: I would *hope* you do.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: How are you here?</span>

<span class="gertrude-nikola">GERTRUDE!NIKOLA: Don't be obtuse, Jon. I'm here because you failed.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: I-I tried. I tried, I almost--</span>

<span class="gertrude-nikola">GERTRUDE!NIKOLA: You almost what? You almost *didn't* doom the world? No, you *almost* let reality be the plaything of a lazy, foolish liar.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: No, no - I would - I could have stopped them.</span>

<span class="gertrude-nikola">GERTRUDE!NIKOLA: How? You didn't even know what it was. Do you know how many people I killed to keep the world in one piece? The sacrifices I made, and you didn't even know what you were fighting.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: N-no, I didn't -</span>

<span class="gertrude-nikola">GERTRUDE!NIKOLA: I suppose it's of no consequence now, it's far too late.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: What can I do?</span>

<span class="gertrude-nikola">GERTRUDE!NIKOLA: [gleefully] You can scream, I suppose. Weep, maybe. Have you considered curling into a ball?</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: Why are you doing this?</span>

<span class="gertrude-nikola">GERTRUDE!NIKOLA: I'm not. You know, it's probably for the best I'm dead. Can you imagine how I'd hate having to watch you fumble around as my replacement? I really cannot express how much of a disappointment you are.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: I'm sorry, I didn't even -</span>

<span class="gertrude-nikola">GERTRUDE!NIKOLA: I fought for *years* to stop the Stranger in its tracks, you didn't even notice when they desecrated my corpse. And now look at me. You've made me part of their ritual. This is *your fault*.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: It is not. It's not, I didn't know. It's not my fault you died.</span>

<span class="leitner-nikola">LEITNER!NIKOLA: [distorted] No, I suppose not. Me, on the other hand... *that* one is very much your fault.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: [despairing] No, not - not you as well...</span>

<span class="leitner-nikola">LEITNER!NIKOLA: *Oh, yes.*</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: He told... why - why didn't you warn me it would be like this?</span>

<span class="leitner-nikola">LEITNER!NIKOLA: I hardly had the chance, did I? Before you left me to get my head bashed in. I understand, of course. You needed a cigarette? I suppose you should have remembered that smoking kills. [giggles]</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: That's not -- I don't know...</span>

<span class="leitner-nikola">LEITNER!NIKOLA: Come now, Archivist. Surely you know what a cigarette is. Or a pipe?</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: It's hard to think.</span>

<span class="leitner-nikola">LEITNER!NIKOLA: If our earlier conversation was anything to go by, I hardly think you can blame your faults on the ritual. Your problems go far deeper than that.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: Just --  give me a moment, please.</span>

<span class="leitner-nikola">LEITNER!NIKOLA: You think that would help? Honestly, if I wasn't so dead I'd be impressed. I always thought my own hubris to be quite exceptional, but you've managed to somehow deliver more bad decisions into two years than I managed in a lifetime. But by all means take your moment.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: What do you want?</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: I already have what I want, little Archivist! Now I just want you to join me for a dance!</span>

<span class="basira">BASIRA: [groans] Ignore it. ignore the uh... don't listen. Focus, think. This is a place. You are you and you're in a place now. If... if it's a place, and it's now, then... then... then it has an end. The other things, the... </span>

##### [BASIRA GROANS IN FRUSTRATION]

<span class="basira">BASIRA: Too much, too much. There's - there's too many. and they wanna hurt me so - so... you leave the place. You leave the place and the now. No place is forever. You know how to move, so do it. Pick a where... then the move.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Do you feel it, Archivist? it's almost there, the new day.</span>

<span class="gertrude-nikola">GERTRUDE!NIKOLA: A terrible new world. It is all your fault.</span>

<span class="leitner-nikola">LEITNER!NIKOLA: Though I suppose you never really had a chance.</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: I *see* you. </span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Do you now?</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: Yes... yes. I see the sad clown, bitter and hateful. I see him finding his way into the circus where nobody knew him. I see him torn apart, becoming the mask, remade by a cruel ringmaster. Sometimes a doll, sometimes a mannequin, always hiding in somebody else's skin. Somebody else's name.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: [petulantly] Not always. And it's far too late for any of that. Nothing you see can help you.</span>

<span class="sarah-nikola">SARAH!NIKOLA: Not without the detonator.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Really, Archivist! After all this preparation, all your research! All this magnificent grotesquery, and what - you were just going to blow it up?</span>

<span class="sarah-nikola">SARAH!NIKOLA: Probably the hunter's idea. She killed one of the couriers.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Oh dear, how sad.</span>

<span class="sarah-nikola">SARAH!NIKOLA: She was also the one that damaged this shell.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: You have hundreds of shells, Sarah! And soon you will have tens of thousands. You can have your little girl within every dark corner of the whole world!</span>

<span class="sarah-nikola">SARAH!NIKOLA: Not until you finish the dance.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Oh, just let me enjoy myself for a moment! This is a once in an eternity event after all.</span>

<span class="sarah-nikola">SARAH!NIKOLA: This in-between is not as comfortable for all of us as it is for you.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Oh, fine. Archivist, it's been a pleasure but I really must -</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Let them fight! It's adorable!</span>

<span class="jon">JON: [strained] Wait, Tim! What do you see?</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: [angered] I see my asshole boss!</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: Or- or... wait... wait.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: [displeased] Spoilsport.</span>

<span class="sarah-nikola">SARAH!NIKOLA: Tim.</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: [snarling] Grimaldi.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: Once. A long time ago, before Orsinov made me. And sometimes, even now, for special occasions. Like your brother. [distorted] **_SHALL I?_**</span>

<span class="archivist">ARCHIVIST: Tim, what's in your hand?</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: [strained] It's... I don't... The detonator.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: That's quite enough from *you*, I think.</span>

##### [JON YELLS]

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: And now *you.*</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: Go on, I'll race you. See if you can do it again before I can squeeze.</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: That's what I thought. </span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: *I am losing my patience.*</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: Back! Get back. That's right.</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: Jon. I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can... then I don't forgive you. But thank you for this.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: You idiot! Do you really make the world will fare any better under the Watcher? You think you're saving anyone?!</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: I don't care.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: You can't even save *him*!</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: But I can hurt you.</span>

<span class="nikola">NIKOLA: It will *not* end like this.</span>

<span class="tim">TIM: [dryly] You sound stressed. You know I hear the great Grimaldi's in town. You should go see it, cheer yourself up.</span>
