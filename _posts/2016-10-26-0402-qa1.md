hi I'm Alexander Jane you'll Directorate

- archive podcast and voice of Martin on

the show and with me I have Jonathan

Sims though you probably know me better

as Jonathan Sims and we are here doing a

Q&A session for all of the most asked

questions from the fan base and as a way

of thanking everyone as well for

listening so far so in that vein thank

you so I'm gonna go through these

questions and Johnny's never heard any

of these before so we'll see I'll see

what he makes of them number one Johnny

is that your real voice I've been asked

this a lot actually and there are

several comments around the internet I

have actually stumbled across claiming

that I'm putting on a bad British accent

and it is of course true my real name is

Earl Big Mac I'm from pencil to key and

it's my rift voice I change it a little

bit I like obviously I do lower it a bit

and go a little bit more a little bit

drier a little bit more academic

academic yes for Jonathan but it is my

real voice my real accent funnily no no

one asks if all of the other characters

their voices no apparently they sound

they sound genuine even though we've

largely come to the matter of meat so

how long have you been planning this is

it something you've always wanted to do

were you actively seeking an opportunity

out for a long time or did you have the

idea more recently that's sort of a

difficult question I guess because I've

been in the back of my mind thinking of

horrible things for as long as I've been

as long as I've been writing most of my

short stories I'd fire off for the

novels I would start and get three

chapters in would be horror of some sort

in terms of the Magnus archives itself

it wasn't actually something I'd planned

much until we started doing it when I

started working with Alex he very much

said

what do you want to write to which my

answer was horror anthology which is how

the Magnussen Archive started and then

the overarching the the conceit that

kept it all together very much spiraled

off into what we now know is the Magnus

are cops mm-hmm without mind how did you

specifically get into writing and how

did you craft the story not in a

spoilery sense but did you start with

the main event that worked backwards if

you let it grow over time basically is

it like all of the court boards and

string that everyone has at home I'll

start with the first question which is

writing has always been sort of where I

feel my strength lies so it's always

been something that I've tried to do and

try to make myself do there's quite a

lot of several years where I've done

very little except tell people oh yes no

I'm a writer I love the process of

creating I hate the process of actually

putting things down on the page but it's

what you've got to do so the answer is

always really in terms of the story

itself I started by spinning out the

central conceit once I'd figured out I

wanted this meta-narrative most of the

very early stories are ones that have

been brewing for a few years to be

honest so a lot of what has turned into

the meta plot came from what themes I

liked from there spinning them out then

I crafted the ending yeah as in the

ending of season five

I hate series that don't have an end

goal oh yeah I am a hundred percent

about closed arcs and there's no way I

was going to sit down and write a

sprawling epic meta plot unless I knew

where was finishing yeah and since then

aspects of the end have shifted slightly

with the writing because they always do

but I still know where it's going yeah

like there's a there's a fixed end point

for this which is always the goal ok

another question for you mm-hm do you

know exactly where everything will end

up in the story or have you introduced a

few threads where you're not sure how

they're going to

solve and just to have it as a throwaway

thing that you might use later the

answer to that question a larger depends

on when in season one you're asking it

to be honest right at the beginning most

things were to one degree or another

casting a line out yeah I would have a

story there will be a few aspects of it

that I quite liked and plans to revisit

later and as season 1 progressed linking

some of those up gave me the structure

to spin out into I now have virtually

the entire story in the entire world

planned to one degree or another yes how

did you start to work with rusty quilt a

lot of people don't really know how the

organization works were you just

friendly beforehand things like that how

did you end up working with us there was

a car boot sale down my road some two

years ago and I mean I'd never

considered myself the sort of person

that would buy a Ouija board but I

perform with a somewhat lunatic stage

show called the mechanisms which is

mythic space pirate musical cabaret and

most years we do the Edinburgh Fringe so

about two years ago now yeah I was about

two years Alex who I sort of knew

through a few people vaguely ended up

coming to one of our shows and saw it

and really liked it yep so when Alex

started a rusty quill he messaged us and

said basically with a open offer would

you like to work with rusty quill at all

the band as a whole largely because

there's no way to produce the sort of

thing we do at speed enough to be useful

in a podcast you could get one Episode a

next month maybe but I said oh I've been

thinking of starting up a horror podcast

for awhile and Alex said great it'll

need a meta plot and here we are pretty

much how far in advance do you write the

podcasts there's obviously an

overarching plot but when do you flush

it out do you just churn them out one at

a time do you have bits of episodes

floating around and put them together

how do they how you assemble

for the seasonal one any given episode

will probably have been written

somewhere between four to eight weeks

before you actually hear it that sounds

my rhyme with season two I've actually

sat down and planned it all out in a lot

more detail so I now know what the

actual episodes are going to be about

well ultimately as well from a

production standpoint I mean season one

was entirely new territory it was a

completely exploratory we didn't know if

people gonna like it so ultimately there

was an element of seeing what worked I

think also faziz until I've been writing

a lot more stuff down season one was

incredibly intricate but also largely

lived entirely inside my head a couple

of the episodes which are dreamlike in

tone because they were written to be

dreamlike others are a bit dreamlike in

tone because it was very late at night

when they were written so this is a

follow on question how long does it take

you to write one story would you say nth

and in terms of just keyboard time maybe

five to six hours for a first draft and

then two hours to edit it and go over in

terms of actual planning I will

generally have an idea and then be

constantly churning it open the back of

my mind for about a week so that when I

finally come to write it I have a much

more complete idea of what's going on

and how it's going to shape up so

another question here how do you prepare

to record an episode Alex died Rex but

what does that involve that are

interested in the technical and the

performing aspects of this so before we

get into the technical on to your side

we are about to record an episode how do

how do you prepare for that beyond just

obviously writing well obviously I've

been fasting for us days to purify the

blood to be honest largely it involves

just sitting there and reading the first

few paragraphs in the archivist voice to

get get my head in the right space for

actually reading it so from my

perspective obviously there's an element

of setup involved we use

various amounts of equipment I won't go

into here but wants all the mics and

equipment a set up what will tend to do

is we'll sit down and we'll just run

through the episode very quickly and

decide if anything unusual has to happen

in performance and we'll address how

that has happened so changes in voice

and pitch things like that if there's

any soundscape

sounds gaping yeah and then beyond

that's the only other thing that really

takes a lot of time with practice when

you have a multicast recording because

that slows that process down a lot

because then you have to sort of go line

by line make sure people understand the

intent of the lines how do you say that

how do you project that and then we're

into more sort of basically the didn't

you once's of it rather than just this

or get it down get a record yeah the

last episodes of the first season were

easily the most complicated we were

doing a I mean we were doing an actual

audio drama rather than an audio drama

resk anthology series yeah following on

figure we've already addressed this a

bit are there any Magnus bloopers has

Jonathan Sims ever laughed ever no I I

laugh a lot

uproarious Lee some might say that I

laugh too much

not many no no I've never actually heard

it by scenario now I assume they say it

but in all seriousness from the

production side we do have a few

recorded gaffes but we're not intending

to release them anytime soon mainly

because it's a bit of a mood killer also

I'm very swearing in real life like that

that sounds like a joke because I'm a

relatively deadpan person but it's it's

not I'm very sweary and this is meant to

have a brackets clean rating on iTunes

so no rude words I could say bombs maybe

but I won't

so again discussing some more of the

production side when putting together an

episode like hive how do we get the SFX

what goes into making those SFX

so a lot of our sound effects will come

from online archives I can't recommend

enough things like freesound.org and

there's a few other sites similar to

that sometimes if you require a really

specific

sound you know something that you just

can't find elsewhere you get out you do

some Foley

truth be told that happens less often

than you'd think like I said those

archives are quite good and you can get

quite good at taking a sound and turning

it into something that it's not for

instance I won't to tell people how we

make the worm sounds but it just

involves a lot of pasta lots and lots of

pasta delicious

screaming pasta in fact following on

from that have you ever considered your

fixation with invasive worms from a

Freudian perspective I'm sure I don't

know what you mean the idea of pulsating

writhing elongating worms tunneling into

flesh is I mean it's just just good

horror really I don't know nonsense

really what are your fears or quite lot

to be honest I feel that it's very hard

to write good horror unless you're

writing something that to one degree or

another scares you a bit absolutely if

you yourself don't have just a little

tingle affair at the back of your mind

when you're writing it it's probably not

as scary as it could be so a lot of

these do come from they might not be

huge fears of mine

but they are things that freak me out to

one degree or another tripper phobia

obviously is quite the one we share

which is where a lot of Jane Prentiss

comes from I'd say certainly the

episodes that are grabbing people in

most it seems online are the ones that

tend to be quite universal and honestly

quite simple so be things like there are

falling yep fear of darkness fear of the

stranger no exactly

so a lot of these are it's marrying as

universal a fear as you can with the

specifics of what scares you so taking

your own fear and making it transferable

yeah so you listen to any episode and

you can probably glean a nugget of what

scares me it's been confirmed that you

like mr james so with that in mind

what's your favorite story of his and

any other literary inspirations I mean

it's it it's called the Magnus archives

the show is the show is called the

Magnus archives

it's count Magnus that's that's why the

show is called the Magnus archives to be

fair there are others that I'm very fond

of from my James weirdly enough I have a

really specific soft spot for a school

story because it is possibly the most

minimalist ghost story I've encountered

that's managed to have a really

significant effect on me so inspirations

other than Mr James I've got a real soft

spot for old school creepypasta who

doesn't when I used to work nights

there'd be some weeks where I didn't

fully adjust to the daytime and I'd

spend almost a whole week in the dark

listening to creepypasta or reading

weird blogs or just going through creepy

pictures and just working myself into a

real state I mean interestingly I

remember the first time you pitched the

Magnus archives to us and you described

it as mr.james meets creepypasta for a

start and you also referenced ionised

yeast oh that's because I again when I

was working night shifts I lived off the

the generation of horror podcasting

there for hours so pseudopod who are

still going strong and the early seasons

of no sleep no point horror and also I

used to delve into radio archives and

one of them from the 1940s was a show

called lights out and it was very much

of the time but it was mostly sponsored

by ionized yeast and every episode

there'd be like a minute-long unique

ionized yeast advert about how if you're

only feeling half alive and you were too

old and tired for your job at the war

factory I sure am discouraged so there

you have it then the primary influence

of the Magnus archives is wartime horror

it's ionized yeast I mean I'll be honest

Alex I've always said that you look

remarkably low on vitamin B and iron

you could put on eight ten or more

pounds of good new flesh moving on okay

these are some more questions do it as

well yes your itself y narrative Li

rather than canonically he does the

Magnus Institute only collate

information are not engaged with their

learnings beyond supplementary

clarification investigation it's largely

because the sort of horror stories I

want to tell are standalone they are the

experiences of an individual when

confronted with something sinister and

inexplicable to actively follow up with

the encounters would turn it into I mean

it would turn it into something that's

more along the lines of the x-files yes

which is a very valid and excellent form

of horror but not the one that I'm

trying to write also it's useful from an

audience point of view to not need to

say go back and listen to everything or

you just won't understand what's going

on oh yeah

but the question same kind of lines how

large is the Magnus Institute as an

organization there are between 80 and

100 staff in total very few of them are

focused on the archives I think probably

the core staff is maybe 40 okay now this

is a bit of a specific one we drill down

to so you've been very specific in the

Magnus archives about the reasons that

Sims is recording on tape but how does

the sound play into this it's an

interesting idea that some things are so

fundamentally unnatural that they would

cause corruption to recordings of it but

what about the music that plays for the

atmosphere is that an actual thing

that's on the tapes and thus canonical

or is it just something for the

listeners now that's something I might

jump in on a little bit please do

when Johnny originally pitched the

Magnus archives to me there was a period

of testing where we actually run a few

episodes that will never see the light

of day and what we were doing is seeing

what sounded right and part of that was

to do with the sound of it so we did

versions of the archives without the

tape deck just to test I didn't like it

I think that it's got a sort of low

fight charm

and then we tried doing them with the

music and we found that the music added

something ultimately from sort of the

directorial standpoint I've always had

it that the music is not part of the

actual recordings yeah

however the tape deck the distortions

the sound effects of things actually

happening the voices of the people

within there are parts of the actual

files the only thing that was added is

music and the main reason for that is it

needed something to fill out that sound

a little bit and just give it a little

bit of pop everything that you hear is

on the actual tape within the world of

the mouths archives except the music

yeah yeah oh and just to say we do not

mean to say that there are lost episodes

of Magnus out there it was largely the

first the first few episodes we just did

over and over again in various forms

yeah we just did multiple permutations

so you're not you've not missed anything

I'm afraid ok now we're heading a bit

more into the sort of fan base II kind

of questioning see with that so with

that in mind what's it like having the

ability to interact so closely with your

fan base would you do it again it's

fascinating gratifying and it holds me

to account I don't think it's even a

question of would I do it again yeah I

mean the answer is yes but moreover the

way that content is created these days I

don't think a creator has an option but

to engage with the community that builds

up around what you do unless you

deliberately remove yourself I mean

certainly you've said this to me before

which is that an element of the Magnus

archives was tying yourself to a rock

and then throwing that rock off a cliff

and you just got to keep writing rope

yeah exactly and the the fans in the

community are a big part of that and I

don't want it then you're back to sound

like I don't love the community

massively it's really gratifying to see

that something you've created has hooked

people but absolutely there's that

there's an element though that once

you're accountable to those fans it does

help connect the paper doesn't it

exactly because it's not just me I'm

responsible to also it is very useful in

terms of writing a story

like this to see which bits of the

mystery which sort of threads are picked

up there are I won't say who but there

are a couple of people on the various

sites and message boards that I keep an

eye on because I feel that if I write

something and they don't spot it it's

possibly a bit too subtle maybe I need

to you know make it a bit more overt in

a future episode and others where I'll

keep an eye on them in case I've made a

mistake somewhere they will let me know

following on from that another question

to do with something similar how do you

feel about the level of scrutiny that

your work gets from listeners does all

of the checking and fact-checking and so

on outweigh the positivity of listening

to people on the forums going in to

their own theories in depth I mean that

makes it sound like having that level of

scrutiny and being called to account

when I make a mistake isn't a positive I

mean it feels a lot like if you're

writing a final exam for instance and

you have somebody standing over your

shoulder pointing out whenever you make

a mistake you might give them a look and

be startled or or even annoyed but it's

good because it means that you're not

writing unintelligible nonsense

and moreover especially with a show like

the Magnus archives where everything is

very intricate and everything needs to

be internally consistent yeah I can't be

allowed to make mistakes because that's

not fair it's straight up not fair to

ask people to try to figure out a

mystery I'm spinning out and then

constantly make mistakes get dates wrong

or feed people false information do you

have any plans to break the mold of your

current narrative style it seems like

there would be some difficulty in

telling the current arc without more

live action style narrative sequences

yeah I mean obviously that question came

in before the finale of season one came

out generally as the series goes on

there will be more of that at its core

it will still remain one episode one

statement one story yeah and the last

question we've got actually at let's try

and avoid spoilers what would you say is

the biggest challenge that is facing you

in seasoned

balancing horror and mystery yes because

fundamentally you see a lot of horror

mystery series that start off extremely

strong and Peter out a bit because at

the beginning horror and mystery are

fantastically good together

I mean because they both rely on the

unknown so heavily

mm-hm and so the unknown feeds the

horror and entices the mystery but as it

goes on the mystery needs to be it needs

to get answers otherwise you feel

cheated

whereas the horror needs to stay unknown

because if you get all the answers to

what the horror is it's no longer scary

and if everything stays unknown and

horrific then you don't get any answers

to the mystery so I would say the

biggest challenge is trying to keep

everything unknown and scary while at

the same time providing enough answers

to the mystery that people are willing

to stay around and learn more and there

are answers you won't learn the answers

to everything there are some small

mysteries that will never be known but a

lot of the why the what the who they

will in time come to light so I think

that about wraps us up here thanks again

Johnny for all of your time and we'll

just go back into the hole you can carry

on writing all the residences no not for

you but thanks to everyone who's been

listening so far it's it's completely

blown us away the response that we've

had from everyone we weren't expecting

this kind of follow along and it more

remotely it's an amazing thing to happen

but if people are able to please do

leave reviews on iTunes and podcast

services write reviews yourselves that

kind of content it makes a massive

difference to a smaller operation like

us be sure to check us out on Facebook

Twitter at the rusty quill the

subreddits our forums at the website

we're also nominated at the moment for a

couple of categories in the audio verse

Awards which are voting is open till the

6th of November for the semi-finals

I believe so if you if you get a chance

to pop on there and give us a vote that

would be massively appreciate again the

response we've had from fans has been

amazing and anything that you're able to

do in that would be a huge help to us

and if you cannot wait

if you cannot hold on if you cannot last

without Johnny's sultry tones until the

beginning of season two yeah you have

actually recorded something with us yes

it is the halloween special for the

gaming podcast yep I'm running Deadlands

which is a horror western setting which

I'm very fond of it's a lot of fun and

yeah go over there and listen to it do

it now you can find that on all the

podcast services that you normally use

for mangas archives just rusty quill

gaming podcast and I think that about

wraps us up so thanks again and we look

forward to seeing you again for season 2

see you then


you
