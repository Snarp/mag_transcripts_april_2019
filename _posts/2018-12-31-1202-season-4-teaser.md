##### [INT. HOSPITAL, JON'S ROOM]

##### [TAPE CLICKS ON.]

##### [A clock ticks steadily in the background.]

##### [The door opens, and we get a brief few seconds of hallway noise before it is closed again.]

##### [We hear a few breaths, and a footstep or to as whoever entered makes their way to the bed.]

<span class="martin">MARTIN: Hi, Jon. _(shaky breath)_</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN: _(pause)_</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN: Uh-hh.. How are you? _(short pause) (short laugh)_ Yeah. Yeah, same here. It's- _(inhale)_ It's bad all over, _(sigh)_ y'know? _[Hold I'm-]_ getting by, I suppose. Um.. Basira's keeping things, taking over, and Melanie is-- _(sigh)_ Well, well,</span>

##### [The "well" turns into a rueful laugh.]

<span class="martin">MARTIN: Melanie is Melanie. _(laugh)_ Anyway, yeah, just- thought I'd stop by. Check in and uh, y'know. See how you're, um--</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN: _(pause) (sigh) (pause)_</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN: We really need you, Jon. Everything's- It's bad. I- I don't know how much longer we can do this. We- *I* need you. And I- I know that you're not-- I know there's no way to-- </span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN: _(soft, shaky breath)_ But we need you, Jon. Jon, please, just-- _(wet)_ *Please.* _(trying not to cry)_ If- If there's anything left in you that can still see us, or, or some power that you've still got, or, or, or, something, *anything,* please!</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN: _(pause, more put together)_ Please. _(inhale, definitely about to cry)_ I- I can't-</span>

##### [His phone buzzes three times-- it's on vibrate-- he gasps softly in surprise. We hear him get up from what, presumably, is a chair, and answer the phone. When he speaks, he's much more business-like, gives no sign that he was seconds away from crying not even a minute before.]

<span class="martin">MARTIN (PHONE): Yeah. Yeah, I know.</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN (PHONE): _(waits for response)_</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN (PHONE): I'm- I'm actually with him now.</span>

##### [He sniffs as he says this, the way you might try to get rid of a cold.]

<span class="martin">MARTIN (PHONE) (PHONE): You were right.</span>

##### [He moves about.]

<span class="martin">MARTIN (PHONE): _(waits) (shaky breath)_ I --</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN (PHONE): _(big sigh)_</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN (PHONE): Will they be **safe**?</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN (PHONE): _(waits)_</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN (PHONE): Okay. _(more confident)_ Okay. I'll do it.</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN (PHONE): _(response)_</span>

<span class="martin">MARTIN (PHONE): Yeah. Sure thing.</span>

##### [Small sigh from Martin.]

<span class="martin">MARTIN: _(to Jon)_ I'm sorry. Goodbye, Jon.</span>

##### [Slight pause.]

##### [The door opens. We again hear the bustle of the hallway before it closes. The bustle is still audible in the background as the clock ticks on. Then-]

##### [TAPE CLICKS OFF.]
