[Music]

hello and welcome to the mangas archive

season for Q&A this is gonna be one of

two because we have a lot I'm here with

Jonathan there's a lot that's there's a

lot and we're gonna be doing our best to

get through all of the questions that

have been raised since the last time we

did a Q&A we are gonna preface this

though with going we have more than 700

and it's still going a lot yeah there's

the Sun manage so is gonna be a case of

statistically speaking your specific

question isn't going to be asked and

we're sorry about that there were

apparently quite a few that have been

condensed down into sort of over

questions there's a couple of questions

we're more than a hundred people asked

some version of the same question so we

should get through quite a lot of them

but yeah we can't do all of them we're

gonna do the best we can and we're gonna

shake things up a little bit instead of

going through sort of blocky like one on

cast one on production etc we're now

gonna be separating out a little bit and

I'm gonna be shaking it up and keeping

you on your toes and silly honest I'm a

bit nervous well if this is a this is a

tricky one because we've taken bigger

pumps with this season so we'll see how

it goes and there are enough people

listening out there now that I can feel

the pressure of history upon mating yeah

I mean if you want to have fun you need

to I can't have fun I can't have fun fun

is fun jokey answers are no longer no

it's great you you need to go on there

Google Trends at some point and look at

these search searches for magnets

archives and look at that nice little

logarithmic I don't know what's happened

lovely right thank you everyone who's

recently joined us listen we 100% value

you and are only a little bit scared

oh no he's terrified I'm I'm at this

point so far beyond the pale you just

kind of roll with it I like surfing an

enormous wave Alex hasn't had feelings

in some years true in fact straight out

the gate I'm gonna use that as my in so

the first of our questions to do with

cast Alex why do you hate Martin so much

that's a real good question okay this is

a very simple question that has come up

more than once

I don't actively hate Martin I just

don't like him and I've said it before

so I will just have to repeat my answer

from before which is he is a younger

version of me when it comes to

characterization and when it comes

script editing I've also done that as

well it is a version of me released

parts of him are a version of me from a

while ago that needed to learn and has

now learned actually through season four

that going around just trying to set

yourself on fire to keep everyone else

warm doesn't work and so I'm actually

okay with Martin PI under season four

for the simple reason that he stopped

doing that thing yeah so I'm okay with

mine now I really like him as a

character I find him through season four

he was quite difficult to write because

often there would be plot points that I

needed him to deliver and every time I

tried to write him delivering them it

sounded it didn't sound right it just

sounded false in his voice what it's

because Martin's default season four

became I'm kind of pissy right now yeah

which makes exposition a bit difficult

but we got there oh and that one's from

aunt Eva I need to remember to factor

names Thanks right so we have a

production question for both of us from

Benja how do you feel about being so

close to the end of Magnus excited a

little bit nervous man yeah I think for

myself we're entering so we're past the

danger period of season four which was

everyone might hate us for what we did

yeah the big the big climax of season

four is always going to be the part of

the whole series that we were most like

worried about that it's been building

for for season yeah yeah

for me end of Magnus is scary for the

same reason that any project you do

which is scary which is you do your

finale everyone knows that was fantastic

and then you're like cool here's this

other thing that we're now working on we

think you're really enjoying if one goes

no I'm good one project per creative per

lifetime

that's the scare is a bit worrisome also

I have some slight nerves about season

five just because for season four we

knew the big drop we were going towards

and why like we know that we know the

the end of season five we're going to

but it's a different sort of journey

anymore our heart yeah I think it's

gonna be the most technically difficult

one for us to write without it

necessarily being the most

risky in terms of like ending the world

with the seasons ago as a high-risk I'm

just glad that here on tape you will

confirm that you're happy for us to do

approximately forty unknowing 's in

terms of audio editing and yeah I'm

absolutely you can write as many

unknowns as you want we're not gonna

make them so you can't just make those

on your own get yourself a wobble board

and just have some fun is that what you

did I mean I'm not gonna go into that

unless it's a question so on to a story

question from Ashley desert willow

Wilson mm-hmm limited swearing is done

for real-world release reasons but is

there any reason for it within the law

does the I just not like cursing in its

statements / meals I mean there's no law

reason except that the characters were

writing on particularly swear II am

fairly certain they would have been more

if I wasn't like oh yeah

no there was hard bristled convict also

cares a lot about cursing if it's of

interest to anyone

there was the piecemeal episode it was

where this first came to the fore

because the first draft of that I filled

it chock-full of swears and Alex largely

actually as a catalyst to have the

conversation and we had the conversation

and the swearing in that one was toned

back a bit and we landed at the level

that we've more or less continued

personally from a writing point of view

my hundred percent agree with Alex that

it's really useful to be able to have

some linguistic escalation yes available

to you which is hard when you've got a

constant stream of expletives pretty

much that I don't really have anything

to add to that bang on okay this one's a

writing question oh this is from sy sy

this season had a lot of focus on

characters emotional conditions

motivations and interpersonal

relationships all dealing with a lot of

nuance what part was the hardest to

write convey in your opinion and what

part did you want to get exactly right

the most

whoa I am gonna struggle to pick the

most I could pick it was sort of like a

highlight reel because we had a lot in

this one yeah when we were doing season

planning for this one we actually put a

little red markers on the bits that we

knew we were gonna have to focus on so

stuff like Melanie's decision ease

decision I think is one of that like a

lot of the series was contextualizing

because the idea of Melanie doing that

as a naturally mentally healthy act it

doesn't make sense really it was

something we really wanted to dive into

but not from an emotional writing point

of view but from and I mean there are

people who are blind and it's saying oh

this horrible thing this terrible thing

of being black like there's a lot to

consider in order to not make it a

really go I was gonna say but I really

like a really bad piece of

representation and we wanted to take

care to not do that also treading the

line for Peter

in terms of everyone hates years because

he's a real world villain instead of her

I'm gonna eat your brains villain yeah

the lonely like diving into the lonely I

hadn't quite anticipated how close it

would Hugh to real world depression and

it was one of those things that when

when you read it back it's obvious but

it was only through the writing that I

started to realize oh this is this is

touching on some very real stuff and so

that was that was a very yet tricky line

to walk another one that I think we put

a marker down but actually turned out to

seem to come out better than we feared

it might is the sort of pseudo addiction

angle on the archivist leaving where

that was one that we were aware could

get away from you if you weren't being

careful about it I don't think they I

think it it seemed to land one yeah it

seemed to lung the way we wanted which

was not as a lazy analog yeah I mean as

a whole because season three was very

dynamic going out there like taking

action we wanted season four to be much

more emotional focused for the the plot

and the emotional arcs to be

much more one in the same I agree I

think what it's worth there are more but

then we're just gonna start listing

episode since we had to be careful with

every relationship every relationship

that got any play in the series which is

all of them and you know what here's a

one little extra bonus one which made me

chuckle who is again I don't actually

engaging the fanbase that much anymore

just due to time constraints if nothing

else and but hearing that people would

start of game getting a bit antsy with

Becerra for being a bit sort of

steamroller e and things oh yeah but the

fact that bassir is the one who was

right all season do it for a given for a

given value of right like I mean this is

not a season where there is anyone who

is right just saying the archivist did

and the world okay if you ever have just

given him a hard time he might not have

done if if by a hard time you mean you

know like it just that completely I

completely stone-cold murdering but gee

well if she could if she could have used

to say who's to say but no like that

this is the thing like there are no

simple answers there are no like oh they

this person was right and should have

just died was the point of the season on

to a a non-story one this time

this one is from you quote loads of

people quote okay I think that's a

natural right bird not bracing myself

how much do you keep up with social

media to see what fans are saying about

Magnus or does Amal keep tabs on all of

us panopticon style and alert you when

something significant comes up I can

answer for me I can answer for Joshua

very much the latter for me at this

point it's like a personalised Google

Alert from annal who's like listen

everyone does worry that you are auntie

Martin is that thing that we're gonna

need to discuss but I don't I haven't

really had much chance to dive into

anything I it's largely because people

were like ah Johnny you're writing lots

of horrible things happening to our

beloved Martin and I'm like yes it's a

horror

on the show and they're like why do you

hate mud and I'm like actually it's it's

mostly Alex and so it's it's my fault I

have 100% out sourced fan discontent on

to you because you're more insulated

from it okay ultimately yeah because if

anyone threatens me I can just make

Martin sadder I tend to on release day I

will keep half an eye on the reddit or

the tumblr and I used to be the discord

I still sometimes do but it goes it goes

very fast and I generally don't have a

chance to actually properly engage with

it

so immediately after an episode drops

I'll generally be trying to get a sense

for how it's gone down and sense for

what the reaction is

but I do rely on annal to let me know if

there's any problems or any like

anything that's come up on social media

that is like oh I should probably

address that see I feel like I've

started to get a bit of reputation as

Gandalf the Grey where I just i only

tend to turn up in the discord now if

something's going wrong as in like

technically wrong and i need to make

sure it's releasing properly so I mostly

turn up with partly to be fair I'm

enjoying my status as essentially a some

sort of chaos God within the discord

where I'll just turn up in their browser

oh is here and then I'll leave Johnny

and then you'll leave yet you'll leave

unable to clean up all of the mess that

we make okay cool I'm gonna jump back

onto a cast 101 I've sort of answered

already actually yeah it's from Aaron

how are your feelings on Martin as a

character changed in season one I can

summarize this one really quickly yep

much like a certain type of smelly

cheese

Martin needed an ageing and maturing

process in order to reach his full

flavorful potential at the start he was

very very fluffy and just there is a

nice little foil as things progressed it

was oh there's a personal Neath the foil

oh they're wonderful oh they're not

wonderful they're problematic but I

season four end of season four I'm

actually I'm firing mine now he's

matured nicely he's ready

be spread over a delicious cracker and

eaten for me it's less a cheese metaphor

and more in season one

Martin was yeah a fluffy character to

unleash some worms on and since then

he's very much Deeping we we always had

the overall plan for his arc but

planning an arc and getting a sense of

how that progresses two very different

things

this is from Gio in previous seasons is

appeared that the only people who have

had supernatural encounters have been

the ones giving statements to the Magnus

Institute when in season four we've

heard about the archivist getting

statements from essentially random

people on the street approximately what

percentage of people in the Magnus verse

have had an encounter with one of the

entities well I mean they're random

people on the street but they're random

people on the street who have had

encounters with the entities it's it's

not the case that everyone who's had an

encounter with the entities has gone to

the Magnus Institute I mean I haven't

really thought about it but if I was

going to just guess a number I'd say

maybe five to ten percent of the people

in the Magnus world who have had an

encounter with the entities have ended

up reporting it to the Magnus Institute

or one of the other organizers and

running the numbers in my head on the

fly in order for this universe to make

any sense the percentage of the general

population that has been exposed to the

genuinely supernatural must be less than

about 1% I'd say probably everyone has

brushed up against them really just in

in the sense of like I mean everyone has

that thing that they're like someone is

there some what no okay I'm fine must be

less than 1% amazing yeah maybe like 10

to 15% have had like I spoke a spook

what what you might think of is just

like a slightly ghostly encounter that

is not significant enough to delve into

didn't really go anywhere yeah and maybe

maybe 0.1% have had a legitimate like

it's a small enough number that it's not

that they're not gonna speak up to

anyone who's not like hey tell me your

story

Alex narratology steer I recommend

anyone interested in that reading up on

the technique of write known as the

masquerade it's a trope or a conceit

the idea being there's the world behind

the world

but there's quite a lot of writing on

how many people within your world are

allowed to proceed if I'm at curtain

before your world breaks yeah and I'm

not gonna go into it here it's a whole

field of study but this interesting I'd

recommend it onto another writing

question this one's from amber which

would you each consider more important

resolving all the mysteries you created

or giving compelling arcs to all the

characters you created do you ever find

there is a difficulty in balancing those

two things in the story arcs and yes I

would agree for the simple reason that

for a character arc if you've left the

character arc unfinished you are wrong

you have you done a bad story if you

leave a mystery unanswered as long as it

is a type of mystery that is allowed to

be announced yeah in some way it's not

quite the dichotomy that it might be

presented as because if you know the

answer to the mystery when you start a

mystery then not answering it is less of

a danger as long as it stays consistent

like you don't change your answer

halfway the danger is the urge to change

the mystery to better support character

arcs or to change character arcs to

better support the mystery really

dangerous where the I mean that's where

the balancing act is and I think there

are a few in Magnus that have slightly

changed their shape or the answers as

they've gotten deeper effectively have

interacted more with people's character

arcs but this is one of the advantages

of writing the mysteries where the wider

answer to the mystery is categorically

known at the start but a lot of the

smaller details a lot of the smaller

threads are still unconnected and those

are the things that can be threaded

through a character arc I think an

unsatisfying character arc is more of a

weakness than an unsatisfying mystery

before I suppose an unanswered character

arc is just a mess an unanswered mystery

is still a mystery it's just an

announcer it's why it's one stuff that

is pure mystery tends not to have a

character arc yeah I mean you eat a

Poirot book like Poirot is not having a

character on what if he doesn't solve

this one John is his character arc is

man who has not solved a murder salsa

barking into massive assault America and

it's in it's because yet so there's no

conflict there between arc and mystery I

know I'd love to read a Paro where it's

the one where he doesn't solve the

mystery and he just has to deal well I

mean if you do want to Poirot mystery

that has an arc for him

curtain Poros last case is probably the

one like the last Poirot mystery cuz

there's an arc okay I mean I'm not gonna

sordid spoilers beyond my sphere of

knowledge at this point Paro is not

something I've done a deep dive deep

dive is really good right we're gonna

jump to a Kamel Jim solves crimes it's

wonderful we're going to jump on them to

a misc which is from a Lucille how do

you feel about the growth of the fan

community during this last season and

the increase in fan creations aren't

cosplay and so on as well as often high

trending on tumblr after the release I

mean short answer terrified good deeply

correct hunter is good the it's a really

interesting thing because as the fandom

has grown it's no longer a monolith

there's no like well it was never a

monolith obviously but it's no longer

the more or less unified group I need to

be a lot more careful how I interact

because things that I would say

potentially ingest like they have resins

now I can't simply have I can't have an

opinion on my work because my opinion is

not an opinion my opinion is something

that people can take and deploy in

fandom context and it's it's very much

like I have made a big party and as I've

made this big party I myself have grown

so that I am now a huge stone giant so

if he attempts to attend the party he

will destroy the party and everyone will

die because he I will crush them with my

giant stone hands that's how I feel oh

you're the kid that made the enormous

Lego landscape that got so big you can't

play with it anymore yes see I have it

far easier I just have my new shield

which is working really well which is

may I just work here I'm the mechanic

that you bring your story to in a life

well problem is there you got a bus

carburetor inmate your character are us

well out us gonna need completely

replace inmate or okay we're gonna we're

gonna jump onto a cast on again Castle

admin which guest voice actor are you

most excited or just very excited to

have on this season that's really hard

actually because I wasn't here for most

of the guest recording this season has

had you out of the studio more than any

other actually yeah like I really was

looking forward to working with Alistair

back and do we have any I think you had

once we had one scene that we actually

recorded a little girl who plays Peter

Lukas has never been in the same room

apart from once in passing to say hello

the other was leaving with Ben who plays

Elias Elias and Peter have never been in

the same room for a recording that's but

not yes also John Henry who played

Arthur Nolan with friends but where we

never really see each other so I was

really looking forward to actually

wasn't that wasn't that so it's been

lovely okay so yeah you can answer this

question so I was very happy to get to

work more with Alistair and and I have

to like in front of everyone I have to

give him a big thanks because out of

everyone he run into an enormous

technical glitch twice in a row oh yeah

not avoidable not a thing that we could

necessarily prep for you know mechanical

failures happened that kind of thing and

the absolute trooper turned up for two

massive pickup sessions in a row

recording opposite people who weren't

here so he's recording in isolation

making enormous journeys to do it so he

he sort of became my MVP by the end of

the season is officially the loveliest

man I had good fun as well working with

Kareem oh yeah because he had the most

fun where a lot of a lot of the

direction consisted of are we thinking

more I want to kill everyone in the room

or are we thinking more like here are

some cop I actually met him for the

first time last night and he's lovely I

was also really glad to get Fran and Ian

that's Trevor oh yeah

Julia back in the studio yes I was there

with them that's fun I was liking those

enjoy recording with them

how many people know as well in

originally started as an editor for us

he was editing with rusty quill for like

a year

and then suddenly went also I'm a

professional performer well bury the

lead so yeah that was good getting them

back into the studio that was that was

good fun but honestly this seasons kind

of been a little bit of a candy store

where I can say that now at the time it

meant all casting was a nightmare but

after the fact it does mean I got to

work with this person and this person

but yeah I think alistair has to win

most MVP and I know he's listening so

he's looking at you okay I'm gonna jump

onto a production question I was weird

I'm sorry this is once from planets and

magic and I should have seen this one

coming I'm gonna read this in the tone I

believe it was intended okay Alex how's

it been directing this season that's a

question that's right literally but is

definitely meant as a how you doing

I probably answer it for you actually if

you'd like go for directing 'he's been

fine directing is actually been quite

fun i've got to work with a lot of good

people the editing and production has

been bad yeah it's been bit hellish this

year and there were a couple of issues

we had to do with sort of delayed

casting and things like that which meant

that we had a lot of very short

turnarounds jeetu stuff happens but what

was that that was something that was

happening in September that was it was a

it was a house that was like a massive

problem I remember someone someone's

getting married that was not a problem

that was selected that was the only

thing there was actually fine that was

yes I got married I got married during

this season which was fine that all went

swimmingly and it was lovely it we got

very damp in Wales it was a very very

complicated season this year if I was

being cruel potentially over complicated

that would be cruel I don't know what

yeah like really cut I feel like

anything that we shifted for the sake of

production we bent the story as far as

we could before the story would

literally

if we'd made production easier we would

have made the story worse which might

have been a trade worth making at

certain points but it's not one we did

so yeah there's a reason that we're

taking a long a season breaking a bigger

run-up because you can only sprint for

so long basically and yeah editors we're

real troopers on this one actually there

was a lot of with the Alistair Sox a

good example hi you wanna have a week

for this and it went wrong we did a

rerecord it went wrong you have two days

to do a week's work and people stepped

up so yeah that was amazing so Johnny's

right directing yes production on to

another story one this is from atomic

pleb as an ace purse so it's just a

great now here's a good name as an ace

person it really means a lot to have

John as asexual representation in a

podcast

can I ask at what point in planning the

podcast you decided to make that happen

that's a very good question and it's a

difficult one to answer because it's one

of those where it wormed its way into

sort of essentially my head Canon quite

early in the writing process and then

later I think during season two when it

started to actually become more

textually relevant we sort of we were

discussing it and we like nailed down

the idea but it's it's a really tricky

it's a tricky question to answer as to

what points that character inkling

became a canonical facet the issue is it

gets muddied up our end in a way we

haven't really discussed before in

during initial like story development

and pitching and so on it was explicitly

stated that the archivist that you have

to discuss what type of story you're

telling and open straight eye Makeba we

were like cool archivist does the

archivist have any kind of romantic arcs

at all through this and we were both

like this isn't a romance yeah it's a

horror joke was on us yeah but what that

did is that muddied the waters a bit so

genuinely had come and pretty much from

the outset but it sounds to thing it's

like I remember it be a thing the thing

is I remember a conversation at some

point during season one where we were

sort of discussing what we thought the

various characters sexualities what yeah

yeah and it was like oh yeah and though

I think John's ace and yeah it was like

ya know that sound that sounds right but

the same time that was

a planning conversation yeah he's going

we need to really have a yeah a sit-down

I think out of everything from the

entire series to date that's been

probably the biggest one that's had a

largest impact that I'm most

underestimated yeah I did not anticipate

the reaction and it's it's lovely but

yeah I didn't anticipate it would

resonate as long as it and this is

something we put a little red mark on

her make sure you handle this yeah I

feel like we have I think so like I

don't think we would have done think we

would have made it explicit if we

weren't confident we've done it

reasonably thoughtfully so we have one

question to decide which is the elephant

in the room Las Jim which is a big

question and we knew we'd end up having

to user so this one is from quote loads

of people sure does the archivist slash

John reciprocate Martin's romantic

feelings for him people have been

commenting on the ambiguity of the

nature of his feelings and would there

be an explicit or forreal confirmation

on whether those feelings are romantic

or not so this is both a very simple

answer and a very complicated answer

the simple answer is yes you reciprocate

sits it's a romance at least I have

written it as a romance it has been

intent it is intended as a romance

however there is obviously a much bigger

conversation about death of the author

and if that's not how people read it

there I wrote a lot of drafts of 159 and

there were a lot of versions where the

archivists emotional states during it

was a lot more explicit and they all

rang incredibly false because

unfortunately I've spent we've spent

four seasons building up a character who

is an emotional emotional wreck he's

yeah he's a mess of a not human and so I

think the scenes that we ended up having

are the most true to the characters I

think there probably will be more

explicit aspects to it going into season

5 I believe so yeah but at the same time

ie as the author cannot tell people that

they are

for interpreting things in in a

different way like I don't think that

people who read it as platonic are

necessarily you know wrong in how they

respond to the text but yeah authorial

intention is it as romantic but also

it's a horror series in its it was the

focus of season 4 because it was the

emotional core that led to the

culmination of the series but it's going

to take more of a backseat I think in

season 5 I think there's two things to

take away from it is one you can't tell

someone how to receive a text and you

shouldn't tell someone how to receive a

text because that's not how art works so

if someone is receiving a text

differently to knew that's fine

the of the one I would say that's quite

important is the ambiguity in 1:59

especially was not intended as a way of

being deliberately ambiguous or people

were left guessing I'll be on is a

symptom of accurate characterization in

terms of how they communicate with one

analyst i I mean to me it was very much

like a combination of a combination of a

love story scene and it saddens me a bit

that the fact that there wasn't the

specific words yes I love you to Martin

and then Vegas yeah oh that is one thing

I will say unequivocably you will never

hear a kiss in the Magnus archives

because audio only kisses are the worst

thing terrible like it's not an option

no one is kissing there no one is

kissing in the Magnus or a couple of

ways of making it less offensive on the

air but it still sounds like someone's

eating chewing gum at you it doesn't

work on audio I'm afraid it will never

will it's the nature of humans and ears

no one likes other people kissing in

their ears in that way it doesn't work

so yeah fundamentally it is intended as

a romance it will continue to be so

through season five though it will not

be the focus but at the same time if

you interpret it differently if your

reactions to the text are different I

mean you're not wrong

because it's art that's how it works

cool a separate writing question that

yes yes this one's from dr. brainbox

have the predictions slash theories on

reddit influenced your storytelling in

any way short answer no I use the

different social medias in to sort of

check different things discord

I generally used to check the immediate

fan reaction to an episode Twitter I

mean that tends to be where I actually

engage with people tumblr I used to

check the how the emotional arcs of

characters are being received and it's

read it I used to check how many people

are successfully guessing well were

successfully guessing about the mystery

because generally with any given mystery

you want a few people on reddit's to be

right about it and quite a few to be

kind of right about it and a few more to

be absolutely wrong I really my favorite

is if someone's absolutely wrong and the

loudest in the room yeah that's that's

great but occasionally you'll stumble

across a thread you oh no that's that's

exactly you've you've got it I can I can

say this now there's been at least one

maybe two this is across all social

media so there's no way you'll be able

to track him down who said hi um I have

a little pet theory it's probably

nothing but and then just laid it out

just yeah just laid out every beam will

be like that yes I brought it for you

and then about 40 people coming going

I'm not so sure

like actually quite a few people right

that's a good theory but there's this or

this or this probably won't be the case

so when you have a reveal of a mystery

you want a good balance of people

feeling validated





it's people feeling sort of half

validated half surprised and people who

just straight-up didn't see it coming

and so I tend to use reddit to check

where people are sitting on that sort of

scale from Nellie beam a lot of funds

were throwing around theories and two

big ones turn out to be true

specifically the jonah elias overlap and

the watch is crown is it cool that the

fans have managed to predict this or is

it incredibly frustrating and annoying

no it's brilliant yes go i like amuse

that you've done the job right yeah

absolutely the prioritization of

shocking everyone with a big twist is

the bane of long term mystery writing

its is a trap because over the long term

if you've done enough for shadowing that

the twist is going to feel earned people

are going to guess it and if you see

that guess happening and you feel oh no

they've guessed the twist i need to

change the twist it's a trap you're

you're absolutely shooting you're

shooting your mystery in the foot and

making it much less satisfying just

because you don't realize that half the

joy of a solved mystery is the

validation of the people who got it

right Jim I mean don't get me wrong feel

three if people are getting too close to

throw more red herrings in the oh yeah

but that's different there's the there's

the old adage what an ending needs to be

both surprising and inevitable yeah that

is true what it doesn't mean is that

your ending needs to shock the very

foundations of every reader yeah what it

just means is that more people will go

that's it that's that's the goal is a

little um also the more people have

predicted the twist the better you need

to write the reveal fundamentally yeah

that's fair actually does raise the

stakes in time you live very very happy

with how we actually dealt with the

jonah elias reveal because everyone kind

of guessed it it's something we'd

foreshadowed quite heavily so we really

went all out on the flavor the actual

yeah the actual writing of the reveal so

that it's not a oh my god

I never guessed its yes I was right and

this

is really cool there's a there's a

benefit actually to not reinventing the

world I mean okay bad choice of words

but your reveal doesn't have to be so

enormous because it reduces the

exposition reload as well if you need to

have a massive enormous shocker that's

coming from nowhere that means that your

villain has to sit down and monologue

and I don't mean monologues like we got

worried I mean proper so two weeks ago I

did this and then I did that we've

managed to cover it up to a degree but

the more that your mystery makes sense

and you aren't having to do that

shoehorning in at the engine the less

clunky it's gonna feel like almond lug I

was quite a because it was mainly

recontextualization exactly it was

saying oh yeah remember this thing

actually it fits in in this way as

opposed to well to support this twist

here's some new information yeah so this

is from for chinchillas one raincoat

presumably an undersized raincoat

chinchillas not very large but if they

get wet

you've got to dry them very carefully

and make sure they get a dust bath

otherwise they can go moldy and screw

this their fur is so dense it does not

draw naturally it's true what's been the

worst normal job you've ever had all of

I will jump in day jobs are bad and say

my track record for work is longer than

it should be due to me starting way

younger than I should have and

additionally most of my first jobs as a

results were really illegal enterprises

that got shut down

I was not Wow I was not being illegal

didn't know this so unless I can I can

run through the list there was one job

where it turned out every Monday they

hired people I worked with them for a

week and they fired everyone on the

Friday but they said of course come back

on Monday and we'll rehire you meaning

that their tax outlays all employment

was zero meaning that they had all these

sales based things that were not

applicable that's one example there's

been another one a fine education for an

entrepreneur there was there was another

one where it was fine but I got told off

a lot because I wrote something down at

some point and it turns out that the

cost of shredders for the immediate

evacuation of the office if it was

audited was so high that they were like

just remember thing

because they couldn't afford the

shredders to shred their records like my

work history is checkered and messy with

other people's immoral decisions my work

history is broadly dull I've generally

worked a series of just incredibly

medium low-key demoralizing but

fundamentally not egregious office jobs

we actually we actually met at one of my

favorite jobs actually genuinely one of

the cushiest gigs I ever got so it was

night shift seven days on seven days off

and you'd get in at 10:30 you'd leave at

6:30 and you'd spend the evening it was

a media monitoring company so you were

you were writing article summaries and

checking that everything that had come

into the system had come in correctly

and there weren't any sort of irrelevant

or like articles that whatever client

wouldn't want to see and then you hidden

spacebar to reject them and it was

silent absolute silent I've never heard

880 people at one point just pure silent

it took about 40% of your brain and the

rest this was actually this was about

six years ago nice spun up her company

at the same time as working it in the

same office on the same computer system

and I was listening to this was before

the sort of the podcast boom had really

hit yeah so I was listening to a lot of

pseudopod and a lot of these tell me

lights out yeah no no like this was when

I would like because there weren't as

many sort of horrible podcasts I found

this archive of old vintage radio shows

and I was listening to of nightfall from

the 80s and yeah lights out with all its

ionized yeast adverts five to ten pounds

of good news flash new flick I'm just so

tired of my this war job of mine I sure

am discouraged if only I had why don't

you try ionized yeast it costs just

pennies a day

maybe you need more vitamin b12 and I

yeah and we we sort of met in the not

silent but still pretty subdued kitchen

of that job through though we didn't

actually start work together for a

couple until I'd actually left that left

that job we met didn't really do when we

met and got on really well and then the

the year I left you came to see the max

up at Johnny kept going on about this

weird creative gig that he was doing

it's like I'm sure it's good

I'm sure fine like sure and then I

actually took up on went on no it's

really good I'm I'm the bad person to be

fit you say that but like the number of

friends I have who do really good

creative things I'm and every time

they're like oh yeah I've been working

on this and I'm like I still have a

little bit it's so I can't really I can

I can't really be mad at anyone else for

not what I've said it before

I have bought four albums in my life

Paul Simon's Graceland and three

mechanisms we've done a little bit

off-topic from what jobs okay cool and

good question from is it flaming or

flamenco

I think it's flamenco bonus one of our

vintage fascist was it intended to have

Alex play Jared hop worth or was that a

late decision out of necessity and how

far did that influence the voice

distortion in that episode there's about

three layers to this question yeah first

one is there were casting issues which

made things awkward so we do a casting

system where there's like a tear of

people where there's like six people per

role and then you have like a highest

preference and lowest preference and

it's not based on talent a lot of it's

based on like availability and I mean

stuff like that so ultimately we were

working our way through the list it's

one of those things about this industry

certainly like at this level is being

able to show up on time and like get

stuff done is often a lot more important

than being the absolute best voice actor

in the room the sad truth is there is no

show

voltage of talent in the world but there

is arguably a shortage of

conscientiousness sometimes so it sounds

it sounds strange but yeah

turning up on time is a big plus so as

it stood we ended up with full

disclosure I overslept this morning

there's an hour late but it's not gonna

now late every single time no and

sometimes two hours so in terms of

jarred hop worth we actually ended up

going through pretty much all of our

choices quite quickly also we did

something that you shouldn't ever do

don't do avoid this kids from lists

doesn't smoke behind the bike sheds and

also don't go oh you know what actually

this person that we were gonna cast this

Jared hop worth would work really even

better in this other role oh yeah just

slowly exhaust your gel and longworth

options going well they're gonna be

better here they're gonna be better here

and then we suddenly realized that we'd

given away a large hour at hop words

well not earned the ones that we hadn't

given away couldn't turn that literally

couldn't make it they weren't three

things like that so then I ended up

doing a test audio showing that I could

do it however it is a bit frustrating to

me in that it didn't need as much vocal

messing around as it had the reason for

a lot of and vocal messing around is

it's in the corridors early doors are

the furnace are messed up soundscape

that there actually is like it's the one

that changes so the most we were

changing Alex's voice so it wasn't as

recognizable we were adding in some meat

sounds because meat sounds yes they're

good and then we were also adding

corridor distortion so just a cocktail

of in retrospect potentially an optimum

yeah so we ended up in a situation where

it end up having a lot more effects than

you really should squeeze into mp3 but

it was just used to stories things that

are unavoidable he's a man made of me in

a corridor made of unreality and who is

three to five times the size of a normal

human being like sorry these things

stack up so this is nice quick one

little asa stuff we said earlier which

is sad and orable you've both talked in

the past about the problem of including

swearing in a show what was the process

that led to martin who's being known for

being polite and voiced by alex drop an

f-bomb I wrote in the script

Alex looked it and said yeah this is the

right time and I said yeah isn't it

because while it wasn't

most plot bomb revelation yeah from a

personal point of view from the

character's point of view this was

possibly the biggest discovery this was

the discovery that most recontextualized

everything about their situation plus I

mean from sake of script efficiency I

can't even his three words yeah and that

expletive is two words so you know this

is an optimum just we drafted the scene

a couple of times and that was easily

the the best version of it plus it was

funny it was funny I like funny and also

shortly after we'd recorded it I

stumbled across the fact that there was

a tumblr that was called hasma as

something like has Martin Blackwood said

yet oh yeah what we we weren't aware of

it until after we've done the record and

I was like oh you sweet summer child you

don't realize you're a countdown right

I'm gonna jump onto another snare she's

nice this is from Beau Geste a real did

the desolation really kill Gertrude's

cats and was that her primary motivation

for waging war on the fears because

that's pretty realistic for a cat person

no no there are some mysteries as we've

established that don't need out although

I've gotten a very small amount of

trouble for this because my

stated policy one the stated rules of

Magnus is if we meet an animal if we

meet a pet specifically yep it won't

come to harm within the episode and some

people feel that

Gertrude's theoretical possible cats

breaches that rule which I personally

disagree with because I mean there is

animal death in the Magnus archives the

point of the rule comes out of

arachnophobia with major Tom because we

actually got a surprising amount of

feedback saying that people were having

legitimate difficulty listening through

the episode because as soon as Major Tom

was introduced it took them out of it

because they were too busy worrying

about the well-being of the cat to

actually properly engage with the horror

so it's very much

so while also I don't I don't

particularly like violence against

animals or animal death in this sort of

thing but it is very much a practical

rule saying no if you if you meet an

animal if you meet a pet specifically

within the context of an episode you

don't need to worry about it dying you

can

assume it's safe and engage with the

story a better way to say be if in all

of these historical accounts that we've

had from Gertrude

there was a cat present that Gertrude

was spending loads of time we a a are we

holding a chill you don't kill they're

not gonna kill that punishment for

another caring but at the same time I

don't feel like saying that there might

theoretically have been a cat who died

fifty years ago actually breaches that

rule also it might not have existed it

might have been a joke I don't know now

you heard it here first everyone Johnny

Simms hates cats hates can't don't say

those things okay

we're on to a writing one again this is

from Chris sterling was it your intent

from the get-go to have every major

character in the magnets archives being

some flavor of queer or was it just a

coincidence I mean not from the

beginning I would go so far as to say

neither now we didn't have like a

checkbox list that we have to hit but

similarly coincidence implies that you

just kind of freewheeling it and you

don't put any thought world that there I

mean though there was some that we

obviously put thought in because the

relationships are important and like

there are I mean there are plenty of

characters whose sexuality has never

been explicitly addressed also you get a

lot of straight characters out there

it's nice to have some others open story

options up as well you're gonna be if

you're gonna be a like horrible puppet

master story writer you get more options

with a broader palette of characters I

mean that is just do it makes things

easier not harder yeah follow-up

question relate to that from Eliza how

do you avoid tropes like queerbaiting

and bury your gaze as a thing when

writing a lot of it is just trying to be

thoughtful be aware of these tropes and

have a wide enough context in a diverse

enough cast and world that you have

story options but they don't necessarily

push you into these problematic tropes

yeah I can't really add anything so that

says straightforward she can really get

in an answer it's like there are plenty

of like female characters who do conform

to certain oh this isn't a great

stereotype sure but at the same time

there

enough female characters that it's not

oh there's one female character and she

is this problematic stereotype yeah

honestly if you just have a broad enough

set of people within your world but read

the might people you all treat everyone

the same they're like their you treat

them like characters rather than like

types we're gonna move across then to

another misc one and this is from abigal

and also I know a few people have asked

this but were there any good cows I mean

obviously question you ever seems got a

cow that's great

okay these fluffy shaggy things and

depending where you go let they're left

alone for like yeah a month for a time

easy if not more they just utterly

unguarded easily huggable doing their

own thing I mean don't I mean I cannot

take any responsibility anyone who

attempts to hug a Highland cow so if you

injure yourself doing so that that's not

on me that's Alex's I mean statistically

speaking they're one of the most

dangerous animals really a lot of people

act really dumb around cows and that's

why ha a cow is when you get up close

spot Alex you grew up in the middle of

nowhere and it doesn't come up that

often um cows are both very very big and

meaty animals that everyone thinks are

dumb and you can do anything you want

around them that tends to go badly being

dumb around cows as same as being dumb

around any other level so you heard it

here second don't be dumb around cows

but there were good cow i think is great

Scotland's full of them ok well you're

gonna jump all the way back around to a

casserole man this is for you Johnny

well I sort of for you you'll see one

okay so this is from Gilligan mungus

okay read as written does your mom say

my want mom and automa logically I think

it is related to the word mother oh my

mom

yes sorry buddy oh yes does your mum

know how much the fandom absolutely

loves her portrayal of Gertrude what

does she think of her immense popularity

she's vaguely aware I haven't actually

spoke at her about it since 160 dropped

if I actually yeah no she but she's

she's having a real good time in terms

of the reception of Gertrude I remember

early in season four I had given her a

script for Gertrude being particularly

ruthless about something she gave me a

call that we were arranging the

recording she's like Gertrude I mean you

know she's a bit of a she's a bit of a B

isn't she and I was like yes mother say

quite ruthless so yeah she's having a

real good time with it basically I was

really disappointing this season because

I didn't allow a cackle of what she gave

a cackle no no she was she was begging

begging to give her cackles right can i

cackle here it's not Gertrude's not

really a casual another cat loves a good

cackle moment and word for word and Alex

you may not be aware but I have an

excellent cackle cackle for you it was

an excellent cackle do only do we have

it on tape yes there is a bonus

somewhere I will see if I can't find it

your mom does an excellent cackle era is

not a cackler now she know who's in that

and your mom was well disappointed by

her this is from AGV Zed brand season

four was my favorite so far in terms of

sound design what is your process for

building sound scapes and has this

changed over the course of the series my

my process my process for the example of

your stay my my my process for designing

stage directions is I will I'll have an

idea and then I'll write it in as

unhelpful or counterintuitive away as

possible such as the world goes wrong as

a classic I feel like somewhere although

this might be in season 2 where it's

something you genuinely put some version

of it's all a bit much in my defense it

was all a bit much and then are handed

over to Alex and Alex will say cool this

mean I need to know interior/exterior

and I'd be like and I'm like

interior/exterior

what a good question conceptually given

this space exists outside of time

hmm and then Alex will say just go away

I'll figure it out well no we have

interior/exterior and Eldridge that's

fine Eldridge is fine it means leave doc

try and make it sound weird without

making the speech unintelligible which

is fine until we're revisiting an old

and Eldridge and you can't pull the same

tricks ie Jared hopper too just so

interior/exterior

weather time of day and I think I had it

they all just happen at some point Alex

I think I don't think time of day is

really no one cares I might Erie I

haven't told Jonny which I have been

keeping a know of which is an extra

column in there which is nonsense

question mark which is nonsense has

Jonny forgotten to mention where it'd be

the kind of thing where you do this and

then he'd be like oh I did you know I

didn't write there is a brass band

playing the entire time I don't know how

I've never put in L for a saloon but

that kind that kind of thing in terms of

how you build it

I was woodwind unfortunately I've made a

bit of a rod for my own back in Magnus

in that we have a very set of consistent

rules regarding sound scaping that

people have picked up on in a good way

so stuff like static applies in certain

situations and dozen types of static are

different that kind of thing which means

that handover in terms of sound scaping

is a bit of a nightmare at this stage

it's a weird one as well because it

means that a lot of there's a lot of

theory that's been built around

different sorts of static static is

something I've been very bad about

consistently saying it oh it's scream

consistent from Maya yes I know

to the point where I've had to insist on

extra stage directions to pick out when

something's compelled or not being Milan

but the secret dirty secret I don't like

admitting which is that it Magnus I'm

still doing the sound scaping yeah

vocals are done by a couple of people

Elizabeth mafia and shout out in this

one she's been really good this season

she's she's excellent Thank You Brock

Winstead has been doing most of the

music we actually shot him as well yes

we did he is the is the cop the police

officer yes yes yes yes muster man and

he got shot cause he is actually

American so we were like can you uni be

an American cop and then get shot

by an old man and both said yes in terms

of sound scaping it's a big thing I

can't go into here like I could run

workshops on it that would last a long

time but generally speaking the best way

that we do is you find out where the

thing is happening you add in three

layers you need a closed layer a mid

layer and a far layer and you need a

base layer a mid layer and a treble

layer how those two interact or you

could have distant treble and close

weather

you basically have to hit those

otherwise your soundscape is gonna feel

a bit flat there's an exception of the

archivist office which is a dead room

and has been from the beginning but

beyond that it's a lot of finding the

right sound effects or recording on

yourself and then tweaking a tenth of a

second 50 60 times and lots of listen to

it not right listen to it lot right and

just trial and error I'd love to say

there's a magic source that isn't it's

just you keep pouring time in and stuff

comes out the other end

alex is radically over complicating it

as always you just write it in italics

ah you know what Johnny's right you just

just left the line at right in italics

it's fine

oh well brackets that's that's all you

don't write it in italics and then you

should go oh yeah there's any remind

later yeah that's it's actually very

simple don't request soundscape changes

after it's recorded that's it that's a

good one ever done that Johnny's never

done that don't do that that's a gonna

that's a no no not gonna bad although I

was listening back to 160 oh yeah and I

was thinking it's right okay we're gonna

keep going and this is a store elated

one which I know a lot of people have

asked didn't Martin say that Gertrude

had been shot at least three times when

he saw the body

yet the recording of Elias only has one

gunshot something happens in the sound

editing some might say he took the next

one might say that certain sound scapers

misread misread this is when the taper

man Elias took two more shots yeah so

basically what happened like in Cannon

and this is the one time I 100% this is

word of god after the tape stops turned

out Gertrude was too much of a badass to

die from just a sing

gunshot she lunges at Elias Elias

screams like a scared child and fires

wildly three times mrs. Gertrude gets a

machete from under the desk tackling

cackling lunges at him but are two more

shots the chest and Gertrude finally

goes down it's not the Alex misread the

script I need there's a hundred saying

only on the record okay because this

this is the kind of thing that can get

away from us

hi everyone this is Alex speaking as

Alex this isn't even like Alex's

characters just Alex being Alex this

isn't a thing the fact that there was

one gunshot there is not a thing it's

it's not it's just I think I made a

gaffe over 160 episodes and I'm sorry

I've disappointed you but more

importantly I've disappointed myself

you've disappointed my mother Alex tell

you what we can do George Lucas in ten

years we can remaster it and Gertrude

shot first that's right this is from

bone god is it if we were to take one

lesson moral away from the story thus

far what would you like it to be

sometimes

okay people make mistakes in editing and

that's okay and it doesn't want to

forgive need to be loud as a give a

lesson or moral oh god it's it's a

really difficult one because Magnus

certainly seasons three and four have

for me being an examination of a lot of

questions about choice and

responsibility and what your

responsibilities I guess are when you

find yourself in situations which we all

do where you are beholden to forces

larger than yourself and the idea that

what you can do is constrained and what

the results of your choices are are

unclear and you can take actions and you

can do things and the results of those

actions aren't actually

to you but that's very much me working

through a lot of my own thoughts but I

don't really have a an explicit moral

it's it's a it's a really difficult

question a difficult situation both in

the show and in real life

it's like I've seen there's quite a lot

of discussion about the ending of 160

and whether it means that for instance

all Gertrude's actions were pointless or

whether tim died for nothing

oh yeah yeah good point and it's a real

complicated question because on the one

hand I mean kind of yes like this is

horror on a cosmic scale and one of the

cornerstones of cosmic horror is

fundamentally that the actions of the

individual broadly speaking are never

going to do good pretty much

but princeless Tim he didn't actually

save the world but that wasn't really

what he was there for he was there for

revenge mm-hmm

nobody involved knew quite how pointless

I guess they're they're whole people

were telling him please don't go off on

a massive revenge also fix your problem

but also it is still very much the

closure of his arc I mean very few of us

actually get our real life arcs closed

saving the world and that doesn't mean

that they're pointless it's my most

favorite way to start a story is it

sounds peculiar there's nothing I enjoy

more than starting a story within a

death that is not significant so not a

death it isn't opening to a mystery it's

a it's a personal preference of I love a

character has died and that's just a

thing that's happened as opposed to a

something that you hang a co off if you

know I mean but no like Tim's Tim story

is is a tragedy but I don't think it's

the revelation of its lack of meaningful

consequence within the wider universe

invalidates those choices like the

choices we take are our choices

regardless of what their actual result

turns out to be

it's the same with Gertrude I mean in

many ways Gertrude is kind of me work

through a lot of my thoughts on

the idea of you know the ends justify

the means because Gertrude does full-on

atrocities she does horrible ruthless

things in order to from her point of

view save the world and turns out at the

very end she didn't need to

and even that those actions

fundamentally spurred the course that

that brings about that end and it's the

idea that the ends may justify the means

but you can never be sure what those

ends are actually going to be good

Trude is an excellent demonstration of

something I've been doing a lot of

reading about in the last year just pure

like me personal interest if you're

interested look into both the

mathematics and the actual just

philosophy of existential risks as a

Thea there's a huge amount of writing

which I think people will start to

realize there's a lot of Gertrude in

there which is talking about if there is

an existential risk where literally

everything's at stake there is an

argument to be made that all acts are

moral if they mitigate that it is not a

to be clear this isn't a stance this is

a you heard it here first folks Oh Alex

yes wants to just do a lot of murder to

save the world but if I put the entire

world at risk first it makes all of my

actions file smart loophole but in all

series and the skier is a good example

of that because it's a good way of tying

back into the cosmic horror which is the

world is complicated and it actively

doesn't like you yes it's an uncaring

hostile universe how do you deal with

that generally speaking as a character

you either find your own meaning which

means that how it interacts with the

wider world as long as your own meaning

is intact is okay which I'd argue Tim

sort of hits that note yeah

or you engage on the Gertrude root which

is know all of this is determined

externally in which case you get in some

really weird personal morality because

one of them's got a give you can't have

both you can't be objectively and

subjectively in the right really doesn't

work like that yeah so I don't think

there are any core morals of Magnus you

create fictional spaces that they're not

necessarily direct metaphors

but they work in a in a space where

people can put metaphorical frameworks

on them and see how they see how they

stretch and there's nothing more

didactic then going in and saying here

is the takeaway lesson yeah and also

because there is no like there are no

easy answers to these questions that can

be neatly popped in podcast format yeah

you know like people have put like

obviously people quite often put an

anti-capitalist sort of metaphorical

framework over Magnus which 100% works

but it's not quite as simple as the

entities are a metaphor for capitalism

yeah you know yeah the entities can be a

metaphor for a lot of things and I hope

that Magnus provides people a space to

work through their own thoughts on stuff

okay so we're gonna round up this first

Q&A with one last question okay this is

from chucking woods mm Alex chuckling mm

woods no truckin words mm chucking a

wood 2,000 times choking okay it's for

mm it's clearly mm chucking wood daily a

1970s horror based on like how much wood

would a woodchuck chuck but they remake

in the 2000s where it's like a reboot or

it's just a name chucking wood and there

have been 1999 ancestors of identical

names let's assume that so chucking

woods mm I guess according to Johnny

alex picture this Johnny just fell into

a lake don't know drunkenly waving the

complete season 5 scripts in his hand

do you save him first abandoning the

script or do you just take the scripts

and go home okay

I'm really sorry chucking woods I drink

so much you have fundamentally

misunderstood the level of paranoia that

I have I rescue Johnny laugh at the

script that's kicking around in there

knowing that if Johnny hasn't got

multiple digital redundants cloud saved

in separate locations that on his head

be it and I'll put him back in the water

so honestly I don't feel like as much of

a quandary there because yeah that this

scenario assumes the ex hasn't pushed me

into the lake because he was

dissatisfied with the season five

scripts No

that's also a valid point if Johnny is

in there with the only copy of the

script Johnny deserves to be in there

because he has violated all of the

safety protocols and I can't be held

responsible for what I do in that

situation but the core question of

whether Alex sees me as a valued friend

or a writing machine I think is and I

think that pretty much wraps up the Q&A

and forth for this episode

well we'll be returning with another one

because we had way too many questions

over the question so yeah we're

basically gonna do an an anticlimactic

by for you by immediately carrying on at

this end
