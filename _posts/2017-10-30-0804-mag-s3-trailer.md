<span class="elias">ELIAS: Something wrong, Detective?</span>

<span class="daisy">DAISY: How many tape recorders you got?</span>

<span class="elias">ELIAS: Can't say I'm entirely sure. We have all sorts of old equipment in storage, I think. You wish to use it for the interviews?</span>

<span class="daisy">DAISY: Probably not.</span>

<span class="elias">ELIAS: And you're sure you want to do it in here? We haven't had a chance to properly clean it.</span>

<span class="daisy">DAISY: ##### [PAPER RUSTLES]</span>

<span class="daisy">DAISY: Won't take long.</span>

<span class="elias">ELIAS: If you say so. I warn you, some of my people have a tendency to... ramble.</span>

<span class="daisy">DAISY: I just need to know where he is.</span>

<span class="elias">ELIAS: As you wish. Who do you want first?</span>

<span class="daisy">DAISY: Don't care.</span>

<span class="elias">ELIAS: Right you are. You'll be alright on your own for a minute?</span>

<span class="daisy">DAISY: _[Snort]_ That a joke?</span>

<span class="elias">ELIAS: Some people find this place unsettling.</span>

<span class="daisy">DAISY: Mr. Bouchard, I'm not the one who needs to be scared.</span>
