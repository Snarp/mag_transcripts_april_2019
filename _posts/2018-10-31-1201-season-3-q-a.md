hello and welcome to the Magnus archive

season 3 Q&A special I'm Alex Newell

director and with me I've got Johnny

Simms I am the writer and I play the

archivist yes so we are going to be

going through all of your questions we

are going to be doing our best to answer

them I am excited but I do have a few

caveats before we start I'm less excited

we've got a lot of questions like a lot

of question alex has a little pile of

paper and a lot of them sort of doubled

up so whilst we will be doing our best

to make sure that everyone's sort of

credited with their questions I will be

cutting through some of the wording to

get to the sort of the the crux of it as

quick as we can yeah to get thanks for

that to get through as quickly as we can

and make sure that we do get to everyone

so here's our first question

Tim not Sasha on the discord asks how do

you plot both in a single episode and

the meta plot what they're getting out

is you use a lot of detail notes or is

it a more vague notion everyone knows

now that we know we have a plan for

season 5 but do we have a ring binder

with 50,000 pages of notes I in the met

at the meta plot is actually planned in

a lot more detail than any individual

episode generally right at the start of

the season me and Alex will sit down and

we'll really hash out exactly what is

going to happen what the beats are

within a given episode ie generally I

have a vague idea of what's going to

happen and then I'll be going away and

just sort of percolating I guess and

sometime in the week beforehand I'll be

like oh this will happen in the episode

because I really enjoy our season plans

where we know all of the like character

arcs and blah blah blah blah but

sometimes there will be just an episode

that says you know spooky computer yeah

and that's just our placeholder what

it's about and then at some point I'll

go very quiet and someone will go Johnny

you all right and I'll be like yes I

know where the spooky computer goes I

know what it links to and they'll say

yeah I have been around those

conversations before ok a follow up both

saz and orable via discord and neuro sot

via reddit ask how far in advance we

plan the characters individual arcs we

have answered this before so we'll get

through it quickly but they're mostly

interested in martin having a crush did

we always know Tim's backstory and did

we know that Becerra was going to join

the team for

time in order right from the beginning

yep about two seasons ahead yeah I'd say

that there was there was some vagueness

but we basically very soon after she was

introduced yes we know in pretty good

detail what our characters arc within

the season is going to be because that's

one of the big things that is laid out

in the initial season discussion and we

have a good sense of what the the

skeleton the structure of the overall

thing is going to be but a lot of those

skeletons are built up with pleasant

surprises and for instance Becerra and

to assembly be Daisy becoming quite as

significant as they were is largely

because the characters and Fay and Frank

are amazing and the actors really came

through and we were like we want to do

more with these characters the flesh

I've good name in red it asks how did

you arrive at the idea of thirteen fears

specifically and with the tag on how

long have you been planning this again

as a the fears right from the beginning

that was very much the beginning like

the building block they want a pitch day

one pitch for the world was the fears I

then went and did a lot of thinking I

looked through long lists of common

phobias obviously I have read and

encountered an awful lot of horror

stories anyway and start to sort of

divide them up and just thinking more

about like how different scary things

feel in terms of the sort of fear they

generate and originally the hunt and the

slaughter were kind of the same in my

mind but the the more I started thinking

about it and we started planning it

properly the clearer it became that

those were actually two quite distinct

and what same exam as well it's one of

the few ones where character fed back

into very much so where it became

apparent that you had two radically

different types of character yeah at

first it was not going to gel yeah first

it was Oh fear of violence nice and

simple but actually the more we did

writing and planning around it the

clearer it became that well actually

there's two yeah there's two very clear

strands here got a question from

we bit on reddit sure has anything

changed drastically from what we'd

originally planned yes and no grand

scale I don't think anything's changed

drastically but that's largely because

the structure we built aside from one or

two very key points that have remained

the same the structure we built was

flexible enough yeah that even though

stuff has changed widely from what we

sort of assumed it was going to be it

still managed to fit very comfortably on

the same structure so this is from

Penelope Twite from reddit and Mika

Cabot's from Facebook cool how do you

balance doling out the information for

the long term plot versus the statement

of the week stuff and more specifically

how confident were we before starting

that we'd be able to sustain the podcast

long enough to actually finish a meta

plush we got it started in terms of

confidence in sustaining it very

confident because i 100% pitched this to

Alex as five seasons it did help when

you won't like sort of horrible

illnesses or something that no one can

predict like we've already locked

everything that I mean fundamentally if

if rusty quill had completely collapsed

if Alex and me both died in fiery

explosions separate fire explosive lorry

explosions though I'd like to think at

the same time oh definitely

if that if anything like that happen

obviously the podcast would have stopped

but you know you can never plan for that

sort of thing but in terms of

foreseeable x' we knew we were going to

go the distance we started it with the

aim of doing five seasons with a strong

ending so it got a question here from

carnation lily to rose from reddit well

we're always planning on having episode

120 be Elias reading the statement or is

that entirely because he got a huge fan

base Oh God why does everyone want no

it's it's fine that's it had always been

the plan yeah right from seasons I think

it was only about it was only after 92

when he started to be properly overtly

villainous sexy so when we were planning

that out there was no way for us to

foresee how sexy Elias

probably be something I blame entirely

upon Ben so this is from I want to say

fix curtain I do not know how to

pronounce that I read it in terms of

writing them not their themes do you

have a favorite power amongst the 14 the

flesh art for the most favorite I really

enjoy writing the flesh because it

allows me to be super weird I can do

lots of grotesque body horror and I do

actually feel quite proud of the

justification behind why the flesh is so

weird least favorite least favorite

probably actually probably the dark just

because I find it draws me into tropes

and cliches recommendable where it's

really really because the dark is such a

well explored fear that and also one

that I don't have myself quite as

strongly like most of the ones I really

enjoy writing the ones where I'm kind of

scared of it myself so I can really

figure out what it is that gets to me

and hone in on it and there isn't as

much of that in the dark so I find

myself having to lean a lot more on

historical stuff residence or like it's

a lot harder to find the interesting bit

of writing a darn story certainly for me

I have a nice simple one for a least

favorite at least which is the spiral

always a nightmare I love the spiral

anyhow stage directions like everything

goes wrong that's a sparse estate I

didn't like em for saying goes I can

write whatever I like it doesn't have to

make sense now links has to make its own

nonsense right going more spirals going

more specific sentient ate from ready

asked what episodes he most proud of um

a few but I thought I for some reason

the one that sticks in my mind is

actually tale of a field hospital

there's nothing specific about that

episode that I'm super proud of but I

really like the narrator and how I got

to write him I was really proud of

finding the book a tale of a field

hospital because so little of it had to

be changed to make it nicely creepy and

it just dovetailed so well in term also

it's one of the ones that I've been able

to dive into the history and more than

just a sort of

dressing sort of way mm-hmm yeah for me

it's anything that's a punch is a girl I

enjoy killing characters that people

love and maybe the replacement of Sasha

by not Sasha was a nice one because

enough people didn't notice it yeah I

was always surprised I guess because you

know it's hard not to notice piling for

duvets on top of the Nazi and just

having a scream so that they didn't

alert the neighbors at midnight yeah

circus masks if I read it are there any

episodes that you weren't happy with in

terms of writing or story I mean yes but

I'm 100% not going to tell never be able

to listen to them without being like

yeah I say it I will however say that it

definitely won't be the ones you're

thinking of so follow up from fix

curtain or FX KTN I still don't know

which which pronunciation VY reddit

which has been the hardest episode to

write and why um I would say that that

would be number 95 absent without leave

and I have no idea why I gosh yeah I

remember we did write which no idea why

that one was so hard for me to write

like it not wasn't emotionally it wasn't

mentally I knew what was going to happen

it just was one of those ones where I

was sat at the computer and every word

felt like pulling out a tooth it was the

first case of block I think you I've

ever really done come up in years so

yeah that was the hardest zero idea why

humid nebula via reddit what is one

aspect event or nuance that you regret

putting out I mean names I'm really bad

with all the names I'm so bad with name

urging no I'll tell you what it is it is

naming the main character after myself

it is not bothering when Alex went hey

rather than making this an anthology

series with you as the host why don't we

make it a long-form meta block thing

where it's the archivist is the main

character and I said yes rather than yes

in which case we better not have my name

being the name of the main character I

believe I remember this conversation

being are you sure you want the all name

to be the main cartoon you were like

yeah I'm sure it's fine like well what

difference is it gonna make from PC i

underscore compliance by reddit how do

you write groups of episodes where the

same events are viewed from different

standpoints

I generally figure out the core of what

that setting or event is like I know the

deal with the Daedalus Space Station I

know the deal with hilltop Road then I

will write a story within that and then

when it comes to writing the next one

I'll think well what aspects of this

haven't I covered yet and then I will

usually have a read or a listen through

the last one to make sure that I'm

getting all the details linked up right

and I'll be like oh yeah through myself

that little hook when we did the first

episode I'll take that and I'll wind it

into this other episode and gradually

just build up the whole picture and I

remember II did baked into Daedalus oh

yeah we will return to this yeah let's

leave this three and then we're like

okay and then yeah we can have one in

season three one in season four yeah

yeah sort of linked adverse inference

via reddit do you feel like you still

have plenty ideas for statements here is

there any media you consume to stay

inspired the media I consume to stay

inspired is generally anyone I talk to

because any time they mention anything

that could be in any way construed

spookily I will ask them to stop and

then I will write it down on a tablet or

a bit of paper or the back of my hand

and I will add it to my extremely long

list of potential spooky episode ideas I

enjoy playing the what if subject but

spooky game yeah okay you'll say 50 as a

joke and then one of them he'll go home

actually yeah no I can also in terms of

meteor I can seem to stay inspired

basically anything but horror not knacks

I read it which came first the archivist

and his journey or the Magnus archives

world exactly the same time as they were

they were built up pretty much parallel

I'd agree with that

Scot um's again via Reddit and there

seems to be very little swearing is that

a conscious decision or did it happen to

work out why don't you answer

enjoy um so episode 14 piece mail the

original cut of that I I remember I

turned up to record that one and I

started reading it out and about a

paragraph in

I said stop this there's lots of

swearing in this one and I said yes

Caesar he's quite a swearing man is is

is this narrator and say no he's not and

then alex explained very very gently to

me about what the explicit tag was on

itunes and why it was a good idea if we

could skirt around it and I said what

about all the gore and the grotesque

body horror and Alex said that'll be

fine and I said what about the the

sexual stuff I mean we've already

recorded episode six and that was some

pretty horrific sexual horror and he

said that'll be fine and I said is it

literally just the swearing and Alex

said yes turns out the US market

especially for podcasts has some very

very specific preferences should we say

yeah and it turns out that it's a lot

easier to market sell and just generally

make things for the US audience he does

let me swear but I generally need to

convince him in any given case so next

questions from cuckoo for cocoa puffs

oh I got out that's why reddit Burke

County got a reference near the end of

episode 58 trail Russians they were very

happy by that yes is there any method

that you use to choosing locations

mentioned in the show right what I will

do is I will figure out the rough

geographical area like the the country

or the sort of the area of the US if

it's set there and then I will go to

Google Maps and I will zoom in to a

level that I think people will find

creepy if there and it gets referenced

and they'll be like why is he referenced

this place specifically and there's no

particular reason but I really like

being super specific deliberately to

just slightly worried people question

from dawdling via reddit's do you listen

to music when writing do you have any

sons that you use to get into the field

of particular powers I do listen to

music but not specific stuff that there

are various sort of playlists of dark

ambient sort of things that I will have

on in the background or I actually find

if I'm finding an episode particularly

difficult just like intense rain

soundtrack heavier than would be

relaxing

so it feels oppressive it's a pathetic

fallacy yeah no absolutely I mean I I

basically in my mind everything

significantly more dramatic if I imagine

it happening when it's raining very

happily I mean presumably before every

writing session you start with something

like they called me mad and then begin

writing or something yes obviously so

this one's a tough one this is from

confectionary via reddit right right

right what aren't Johnny and Alex's

values when it comes to horror as in

what should well-written horror fiction

accomplish other than scaring people

obviously to me there are almost two

sorts of horror there's what I think of

as escapist horror and what I think of

as literary horror escapist horror is

it's very practical in a lot of ways it

is a way of catharsis it's a way of

indulging in fear and spooking yourself

out in a controlled safe way allowing

you to safely indulge in in those

slightly darker emotions and feelings

which is one of the reasons that for

Magnus I think it's so important to take

certain certain boundaries and treat

certain subjects with a lot of respect

and sensitivity because one of the key

things here is you need to be able to

trust that you can enjoy the horror you

need to be able to trust the the writing

and the performance that it's not going

to suddenly cross lines and what has

previously been a very pleasing spooky

catharsis suddenly becomes incredibly

upsetting and of course I think there is

the other sort of horror and obviously

it's not it's not a binary here it's

very much it's more of a spectrum it's

very much on on a spectrum but what I

think of more as literary horror which

is using the mechanisms of horror the

mechanisms of being spooky being scary

to actually examine and come to terms

with darker subject matter

literary horror is just as thoughtful

about how it engages with that sort of

thing and to be honest I don't write

literary horror I don't really feel like

I have any place writing literary horror

most of the most of the subjects that it

tackles that it deals with Wow are

things that I have no real experience of

and that I would not be coming from a

place where I'd feel comfortable

exploring exes it's there often not my

stories to explore hmm mine is gonna be

a lot more specific but I think a lot

less profound let's say um I think that

in all fiction you should have like I'm

gonna have to expand on this you should

avoid being intellectually lazy and I

think with horror more than any other

genre and more than any other type of

fiction you must not be intellectually

lazy now to be perfectly clear I'm not

talking about you know using big long

words or writing it in a weird way that

no one's ever seen when I'm talking

about intellectually lazy I'm talking

about knowing that there's a better way

of doing something and then taking a

shortcut it's stuff like for horror it's

very easy to spot the the shortcut

because what someone will do is they

will write a taboo and then look at the

taboo and go

I broke a taboo horror and it's not it

is a shortcut because you aren't putting

the work in to really engage with stuff

and try and pick out the bits that are

interesting you are just taking

something wholesale and slapping it out

there and that for horror bizarrely is

the thing that encourages people to take

those shortcuts most yeah and especially

things like body horror actually that's

the one most often yeah you're heading

into like horrible like torture porn

kind of subgenres and stuff and actually

it doesn't need to be that and it's just

about putting the work in and not just

taking the quick easy low-hanging fruit

every time when we talk about being

intellectually lazy we a hundred percent

are not talking about being original no

no no

weirdly horror is actually one of the

genres where I feel like you thinking

about it in terms of originality is

actually missing a lot at the point

there's only so many spooky things

you can write it's all to do with the

rhythm and the pacing and making sure

that you're getting the the right beats

in the right place to evoke the the

emotions the same way that you know you

need to evoke the right notes from an

instrument and Astrix how are the

editors doing right now

it must be hard having huddle with all

the recent stuff they're fine they've

been having some lovely weeks they're

safe and alive

do not look for them how do we get in

the zone of giving the exact emotion

need for a piece especially in recent

episodes I'm gonna give the the unsexy

uncreate Avance ER here which is

honestly 90% of the decisions are based

entirely on logistics it is I mean

obviously that there are creative

decisions in terms of like you know I'll

the buried should be Basie and

Nicola Ross enough if anyone's listening

out for it has like the sound of like

needle scratches on LPS and stuff but in

a lot of it a lot of the decisions are

less about mood than about okay Johnny

has requested thousands of people

screaming and this and this and this and

this that's not gonna be possible so

easy to write it in so what I do is I

write down what it is in order that I

can get away with and then I'll actually

experiment and certainly when it comes

to the soundscape enos is true for the

music I have to hand all credit to Brock

he's been doing a lot of the music this

season and he's frankly better at it

than I am he's getting very very good at

replicating mood with music in a way

like I'm less skilled at when it comes

to the soundscape inside a lot of it is

just you keep trying permutations until

something works which means that I also

have full soundscapes that we've never

used because when you laid them up they

didn't work sumo boom oh by a discord

how do we achieve the convincing sounds

of violence so there are there are three

tips that I ask if I'm not gonna go into

the specifics of it it will take hours

tip number one get your performers to

physically act out stuff in the studio I

don't mean fully but generally speaking

not only each other but on themselves I

get them to hold their sort of shoulders

hold their own shot what are you doing

okay so effectively everyone holds their

own shirts and then you sort of wiggle

that's the best

can describe wiggle in the correct

literally right now what I'm doing is

just holding my lapels oh and in the

table because that wasn't that wasn't

controlled or safe way to do it don't

don't follow in our footsteps kids so

step two once you've done that is you

want to find all of the correct sound

effects do not pick sound effects that

are accurate pick sound effects that

sound right melons are your friends

melons punch well they smash well they

grind well they're great and the last

step is when it comes to things layer it

up too many people spend hours and hours

and hours and hours and hours trying to

get the perfect Foley you know hitting a

melon in 50 different ways to find the

right one nine times out of ten just

layer three different sounds together

and you will get it sounding right as

the sort of bonus tip for every one base

if you want something to sound heavy

into some like it hurt use more base

less treble okay which was our favorite

episode or scene to record this season I

I mean I'd love to answer you Alex but

where Johnny you produce a ridiculous

amount of salt maybe Johnny was was

right right to believe that the only way

he could possibly record being bound and

gagged is doing entire recording you

literally just shove as much of your

fist into your mouth as you can and then

try to speak and it's it's not a

pleasant thing to do but it that that

there's a just funny it's it's a weird

one and I'd say probably my favorite

from this season I did actually enjoy

bizarrely recording with Laurie for

Martin's new in episode 102 clip be

clear 100 actually my least oh yeah I'm

but I'm very sorry about that I mean I

know I'm not but that specific scene was

just me and Laurie getting into a room

I'm an improviser she was an improviser

we just hit record did it and then

stopped and you just tried to make each

other Corp so that was actually quite

pleasant but with the exception of that

scene it was a nightmare okay from Steve

brad beyer edit all of the statements in

100 are they or are they not truly

supernatural yes they fall 100% under

the standard rule you will only hear

recordings about statements that are

supernatural because otherwise it's not

fat all the red spring brigade correct

okay the dialogue was largely improvised

what was the process behind that how

much freedom did the Hat actors have

well okay so what I did was I wrote

about a paragraph that was what had

actually happened then I wrote a bunch

of bullet points about the character

giving the statement about what they

might get sidetracked on what they're

sort of particular or the bits that they

couldn't get past were and just

generally how they were a nightmare to

try and get a statement out of and then

I let them go and then once we got that

I sat down with the actors I discussed

it briefly

and then unfortunately because of the

nature of the show it's very difficult

to improvise well to it so what ended up

happening is we would do a recording we

would then stop evaluate do recording

again stop evaluate do recording again

for some of them we went as far as like

eight regions of the court or some

normally within craft you just run the

thing let it go because Magnus is very

specific and it's very easy to go off on

a tangent when you're improvising and

say something that's non canonical or

couldn't work so what it's more like is

we'd get the first two minutes me like

that's a nice two minutes and then we'd

focus on the next two minutes asinine

another nice tune and keep doing that

but yeah that was that was a strange one

yeah I feel like I think it came out

very well but it's not method that I

would want to use again certainly not

for this show what made us decide on a

more lighthearted episode episode

hundred in it I mean it's what you do

you know episode 100 has got to be a

change of pace and it's got to be nicely

self referential it's got to be just a

little bit of a victory lap because

you've made it to a hundred episodes we

did discuss it well in advance you know

what we wanted one hunter and to be fair

when we were planning season three we

were like oh oh this is a really good

way to answer everyone who's like ah I

mean does the magic sounds very eloquent

as does the magic power also make them

really eloquent storytellers yes it does

okay next questions from carnation lily

to Rose I read it and for one more nine

that had to have been brutal

with your parents berating your

alter-ego so was it difficult to hear

your parents reading those lines at you

not even a little bit it was hilarious

I've got like I've got a weird but a

very good relationship with my parents

like by this point in season three like

right at the beginning of season one

there were like quite a lot of elements

of the archivist that I saw within

myself and like he was a little bit of a

fictionalized version of me for like

maybe the first 20 episodes but as soon

as plot actually starts happening he

very quickly went on her like who went

on a strong right-angle character you're

less of a hot garbage fire of oh you

know I'm I'm I like to think my

decisions are less overtly horrific in

many ways it was quite cathartic for me

because it allowed me to have these two

authoritative figures within the

universe just eviscerate the idiot that

shares my name a path or us via reddit

do you ever have any issues coming up

with names to use in character

statements rather than you know reusing

everyone you know as obviously I do

obviously I do why would you ask that

question the name Alex

penultimate episode of season five when

you can't cancel anything let's let's

address the elephant in the room this

has been asked by a bunch of people but

especially carnation Lolita Rose and

others is Tim actually dead dead or just

mostly dead he is dead tim is dead so

dead however while we make a point not

to bring people back from the dead in

Magnus I know it sometimes feels like

that but we are very careful to never

actually resurrect anyone

we're very happy to play fast and loose

with what might have happened to

somebody pre death and we're not shy

about having dead people talking in

various ways we're very keen to keep

death meaningful yeah

and it's important to horror exactly and

so why obviously I mean Gertrude's been

dead the entire time

so we've heard plenty from her so I'm

not gonna make any blanket statements

that you'll never hear Tim's voice again

but Timothy Stoker is dead yes

plunder duck and liquid mirrors via

discordant read 8 respectively ask Elias

are we gonna get more of him are we

gonna get more backstory of him how did

he turn from a pot head to a high priest

of The Watcher no you're not I mean he's

he's in prison now so that's that's him

done I don't think we'll be seeing him

again satisfying yeah I feel like he

developed as a character and then we

wrote him out elegantly

although Easter overstayed his welcome

from Alcide yeah yeah

realistically yes obviously we would be

typing poor into what the deal is with

Alliance okay Georgie bye D Ashley well

we hear more from Georgie and especially

her auntie fear power that's not the

phrasing of the original question just

perm yes we'll be hearing more from

Georgie 71 Penguins V already asks what

about Agnes what about Agnes what a

great question your answer I mean again

yes we will be getting more from Agnes

from cats using coconuts via reddit what

about Michael is Michael just Helen now

and that's the end of Michael in the I

mean in the same way that Tim is dead

Michael is Helen okay we've got a lot of

questions actually about this so I've

lumped together the other institutions

oh yes so mark Sutton via Facebook and

others the Osher Institute what's the

deal what can you tell us about them is

there a chance that we'll see their

people in future episodes right the Asha

foundation is the American sister

institution to the Magnus Institute and

they are similar but different they will

almost certainly not appear in the main

story in any significant way the writing

point of view I want the Magnus archives

to be a world as well as a story yeah

and I'm always acutely aware that the

more everything mentioned is super

significant and everything mentioned

ties into everything else the more it

becomes a locked-down story and the less

it becomes an open world so I'm always

very keen to add in just little things

that maybe will you'll you'll know

here about again but they yeah they

fleshed out and they give jumping-off

points for a wider world that anyone

wants to explore in so this one's from

polyphonic by discord from other tapes

or other recording devices that are able

to hold statements purely neutral or

other is there a capacity for an entity

to maybe enlist them to their aid like

they can with humans they are not

neutral next question

Hobbs by discord in mag 87 the uncanny

valley we learned that Gertrude

presented the desolations ritual what

are the deets can we know what the

ritual was what it was called what it

might have looked like etc it said 100%

can know those things next question

I mean wait is is the answer to that

okay so historic references oh okay so

from self-referential main vie ready at

liquid mirrors about reddit and others

as an example we got Wolfgang von

Kempelen and Library of Alexandria and

so and so on and what are the historical

figures organizations and events are

associated or puppeted by some power is

there anything that you can go into oh

that's a very good question and the

answer is yes and I know one or two of

them but if I already know them it's

because they're gonna be coming up in a

later story I can't actually say

anything I mean there's so much that

I'll be like oh maybe I should do

something with this historical event all

oh what's the deal with like I mean the

whole Wolfgang von Kempelen thing came

with me going like oh I haven't done

much with automata yet yeah what's the

deal with historical automata and then I

looked in and I was like oh cool so yeah

the Mechanical Turk that's intro oh I

can use that

and who was he but I've also come from

Compellent and then I read compelling

biography and I was like yeah what a

spooky

he made a speaking machine that just

goes and and like it's so often they're

like if you actually just dive deep

enough into a bit of history you'll be

like okay so the aunt the short answer

is yes they'll they'll almost certainly

have been quite a few and I'll be diving

into

as many of them as I can find and have

time for because honestly that a lot of

that history stuff is it's certainly one

of my favorite bits of the writing for

Marimo discord does the archivist taking

on the persona of people's statements

revitalize him what does the archivist

just have a secret pastime of putting on

different personalities really well is

this is John a secret Impressionists we

thought I mean lore why is the first one

though we came to the conclusion very

early in recording season one the the

archivist is secretly a bit of a drama

queen

yeah really likes like it's it's 90

percent a hostile malevolent alien force

that was given but I mean fundamentally

he doesn't not like getting into a

statement and really giving it a bit of

a like he probably did some and ran okay

this questions from duck pond by discord

does Tim have any hobbies unrelated to

revenge not anymore

no did Tim have any hobbies unrelated we

always thought of Tim as one of those

people who like he's very social but

rather having like a lot of hobbies in

his downtime he would go on big holidays

adventure holidays like he probably does

likes did did some rock climbing I

always teach him kayaking

yeah kayaking yes always sucked him down

as he doesn't do it all the time

no but he makes the point of his his

main holiday yeah yeah of the year is

always kayaking I don't know why I I

think of it less specifically as

kayaking like he's not gonna he's not

gonna say no to like you know a bit of

scuba or or that sort of thing but but

yeah like I think for most of us is time

he would just general socializing

relaxing I think he probably I think he

probably played a reason why mantle like

console computer games and I couldn't

judge that maybe he was too busy

kayaking in my brain but but yeah like

active social adventure holidays

dead oh that's brutal so this next one's

from southern dorable hi discord sure

what cat is the inspiration for the

Admiral what's their name and how

precious are they okay so the Admiral is

an amalgamation of all the cats in my

life I have a real fondness for pets

with like Appalachians or ranks what are

the names of your cats Joe I have two

cats one of which is Sir pounce a lot

yes that is the reference and one of

which is the ambassador ambassador cat

it should be noted that cat is his name

and he is an ambassador he is not

ambassador cat in the sense of you know

ambassador to all cats he is an

ambassador his name is cat and he

happens to be a cat from Seraphim 755 I

read it how do you feel about fan made

podcasts riffing off the Magnus archives

for instance a registering podcast where

fans discuss episodes and the

connections between them or a fun based

non canonical podcast dealing with

statements given to the usher foundation

very flattered probably a little bit too

intimidated to actually listen so now

they're boring a business II not nice

part hat on the licensing is creative

the original source material as much as

possible basically I have to say that of

the to the OSHA foundation one carries a

little more complications because of

things to do like like trade marking and

branding and so on

next questions from Satanist goblin by

reddit what is your favorite podcast not

from rusty quill i binge podcasts quite

a lot so for me the answer is almost

always going to be different my my

favorite favorite podcast at the moment

and I'm very happy I can give them a

shout out because they give it they gave

us a really nice shout-out on their last

episode is Epoque repels I have that

they are they're sort of a secular Bible

studies podcast by two comics writers

and it sounds really dry but it's

incredibly interesting and really really

funny because yeah

I knew the playbook quite well turns out

I basically didn't know it at all and it

is really interesting and really weird

even from her like a non-religious point

of view just as like a foundational text

result of a lot of society it's

fascinating and they are very very

informative and very very funny so it's

bonito Sereno and Chris Sims and they

are awesome I think they're probably

listening so guys aside from that

pseudopod is all good nice horror is

always good I'm I've been going through

the back catalogue of shut up and sit

down

recent yeah because I've I mean I'm a

real board game phase at the moment so

from my perspective I listen to a lot of

audio drama shocker

I often reticence recommend audio drama

like pick favorites and stuff yeah yeah

because it's a it's it's a dangerous

game because it makes people it makes it

sound like you're saying some are better

than others that said I would say I

recently finished and really enjoyed

wolf three five nine oh yeah done wolf

like as a personal taste thing I enjoyed

it had good fun with it in terms of

things that aren't audio drama so I'm

quite peculiar in that my odd my tastes

outside of audio drama are really really

generic like holy they're always

recommending me like stuff you should

know yeah and history of Rome great

podcasts to be fair it's good for me

because sometimes you'll be like oh

here's an interesting episode on

something that could be very easily made

spooky and elicited and be like yes I

can very easily make that spooky so a

nice adorably naive question here from

liquid mirrors via reddit if rusty quill

as an organization served a power which

would it be I think the web okay I think

I think that was very conclusive I

couldn't disagree um wicked I think

that's everything apart from thanks for

listening as always thank you I think

this is probably going to be whiter

chunky one almost certainly we will have

a reduced version coming out for public

so that no one has to listen to us

ramble on for ages but if you happen to

enjoy us rambling on for ages there will

be a full version of this on the patreon

speaking of which big thanks to all of

our patrons who have basically been

funding our way through this yeah this

season thank you do not have happened we

season 1 on 2 we got by we sort of we

show that a lot

season 3 would not have happened

categorically so thank you so much

thanks to everyone who has been sharing

it's weird to say but everyone in the

fan community has been putting in so

much work on a hub there huh yeah I
